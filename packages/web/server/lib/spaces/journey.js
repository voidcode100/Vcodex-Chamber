// The journey of a space as the host drives it: made with its network choice and the project's
// code, listed with its state, started again with its network said again to a gatekeeper that
// forgot it, stopped, removed with everything the host kept for it, its journal read, and its
// work brought out and applied. Everything here is written once on top of the manager, the
// gatekeeper channel, code in and code out; the routes in `routes.js` only translate HTTP.
//
// A creation runs in the background: the request comes back at once with the space's id, and the
// steps are announced as `openchamber:space-progress` events on the host's hub, so the group in
// the sidebar can say what is happening now (DESIGN.md, journey step 2). A creation that fails
// after the containers exist removes them again, and its failure stays listed until the user
// dismisses it, so an error is never silent.
//
// Grants, since 5b: a model key the gatekeeper's window adds to the provider's requests, or an
// opened domain the window forwards to with no credential. The host keeps the grant without its
// value (decision 5) and says it again to the gatekeeper after every start; a value it cannot
// find again leaves the space "needs access" until the user grants once more.
//
// Repair, since 5d-2 (DESIGN.md, journey step 8 and decision 10): restart OpenCode inside, and
// restart the container with a fresh token for the server inside. A space whose gatekeeper is gone
// is listed as such, because no restart brings it back.
//
// Idle stop, since 5d-3 (decision 11): the server inside stops itself after the user's idle hours.
// The host tells it the setting at every start and whenever the user changes it, lists a space
// that stopped that way as such, and stops the gatekeeper it finds running beside a stopped space,
// which is what an idle stop leaves while OpenChamber is closed.
//
// Setup commands, since 5d-4 (DESIGN.md, "Code in and out"): the project's worktree setup commands
// run inside the space once its code arrived, in the background, and again when the user asks.
//
// The chat archive, since 5e-2 (decision 9, journey step 7): a delete takes the space's chats to
// the host's archive first, starting a stopped space for it, and deletes nothing when they cannot
// all be saved, unless the user said to delete anyway. See `space-archive.js`.
