 * The connection caps this gatekeeper runs with, and they are as small as the assertions allow.
 *
 * Small because a test has to exceed one, and a drop only happens when a connection is *accepted*
 * past the cap: a loaded machine accepts slowly while the kernel's backlog keeps completing
 * handshakes, so a flood of 300 clients against the production cap of 128 can leave every client
 * connected, nothing accepted past the cap, and the flood unrecorded. Measured that way with the
 * program stopped: 128 connected, no note, ever.
 *
 * And small because sockets are the scarce thing on a Windows host, where a closed port waits two
 * minutes in TIME_WAIT before it comes back. Beside the three live Docker files, which hold the
 * daemon for five to six minutes each, this file's worker died there. A flood proves "the cap
 * refuses beyond it, and the refusal is noted once" at four as well as at a hundred, so the whole
 * two loops that dominate this file now cost 124 sockets instead of 240: 60 for the refusals
 * that must outnumber the cap, against 144, and 64 across the three floods, against 96.
 *
 * The corridor's is the one that cannot go lower: the program waits on up to 16 refused clients
 * at once, and a cap at or under that would be filled by refusals alone, which is the opposite of
 * what the test beside it proves. 20 leaves room for the handshake in flight.
 *
 * The production numbers, 128, 64 and 8, are in the container command, which `docker.test.js`
 * asserts whole, so nothing here can raise them.
