# Quota Module Documentation

## Purpose
This module fetches quota and usage signals for supported providers in the web server runtime.

Node server entrypoints apply `../network-defaults.js` before serving requests,
including the daemon launched directly through `server/index.js`. Connection
attempts get 5 seconds without changing address-family selection. The VS Code
extension applies the same policy in its own process at activation.

## Entrypoints and structure
- `packages/web/server/lib/quota/index.js`: public entrypoint imported by `packages/web/server/index.js`.
- `packages/web/server/lib/quota/routes.js`: Express route registration for quota endpoints.
- `packages/web/server/lib/quota/providers/index.js`: provider registry, configured-provider list, and provider dispatcher.
- `packages/web/server/lib/quota/providers/google/`: Google-specific auth, API, and transform modules.
- `packages/web/server/lib/quota/providers/claude/`: Claude credential discovery, usage transforms, and rate-limit handling.
- `packages/web/server/lib/quota/utils/`: shared auth, transform, and formatting helpers.

## Supported provider IDs (dispatcher)

These provider IDs are currently dispatchable via `fetchQuotaForProvider(providerId)` in `packages/web/server/lib/quota/providers/index.js`.

Where this table says "OpenCode `auth.json`", the credential is the one the
running OpenCode uses (stored, or from an environment variable when
OpenChamber launched OpenCode), read through `../opencode/auth.js` (`GET
/api/credential`, see the opencode module docs); the name is the legacy shape
the entries keep. The provider list reads it once and hands it to every
`isConfigured(auth)`; each `fetchQuota` reads it again. When OpenCode cannot be
asked, `/api/quota/providers` answers 500 instead of an empty list.

## Internal-only provider module
- `providers/openai.js` exists for logic parity/reuse but is intentionally not registered for dispatcher ID routing.

## Response contract
All providers should return results via shared helpers to preserve API shape:
- Required fields: `providerId`, `providerName`, `ok`, `configured`, `usage`, `fetchedAt`
- Optional field: `error`
- Unsupported provider requests should return `ok: false`, `configured: false`, `error: Unsupported provider`

Provider modules must export `providerId`, `providerName`, `aliases`, `isConfigured(auth?)`, and `fetchQuota()`.
`fetchQuota()` should return a quota result with `usage.windows` keyed by window name (for example `5h`, `7d`, `daily`) and optional provider-specific `usage.models` data.

exe.dev, Ollama Cloud, and Cursor credentials are explicitly managed through Settings. exe.dev usage uses a separately generated HTTPS API token restricted to `billing credits usage` and aggregates every `exe-*` model provider into one monthly credit window. Generate the token with `ssh exe.dev "ssh-key generate-api-key --label=openchamber --exp=30d --cmds='billing credits usage'"`. OpenCode Go usage uses `GET https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage` with the `opencode-go` API key from OpenCode `auth.json` as a bearer token and the stable `x-opencode-session: openchamber-usage` workload id. The server validates managed credentials before atomic `0600` writes and never returns secrets through its API. OpenChamber never scans browser cookie stores or automatically reads Cursor storage; Cursor import is an explicit one-time user action and never modifies Cursor's database.

Command Code usage resolves account scope through `GET /alpha/whoami`, then reads server-backed credit balances and five-hour/weekly limits from `GET /alpha/billing/credits?orgId=...`. Personal accounts return `org: null` and use `/alpha/billing/credits` without an `orgId`; organization accounts include their organization id. Web/Electron and VS Code read the standard `command-code` OpenCode auth entry (including OAuth `access`) or `COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY`; credentials remain in the owning runtime and are never returned to shared UI.

On the first OpenCode Go usage refresh after upgrading, OpenChamber deletes the obsolete `quota/opencode-go.json` credential file without reading its cookie value.

## Claude credential and limit semantics

Claude quota reports the subscription limits Claude Code itself is bound by, read from `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`.

- **Credential sources**, in priority order: the macOS Keychain entry `Claude Code-credentials`, then `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/.credentials.json` (the Linux/WSL location), then the OpenCode `auth.json` entry, then `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. The Keychain wins on macOS because the credentials file there is a leftover Claude Code no longer updates.
- **All sources are read-only.** OpenChamber never writes to Claude Code's credential store and never refreshes the OAuth token, because Anthropic does not support two live refresh tokens for one `client_id` — refreshing here would sign the user out of Claude Code. Credentials are read fresh per request so a Claude Code refresh is picked up immediately; an expired token yields an explicit "open Claude Code to sign in again" error rather than a bare 401.
- **Limits come from the `limits` array**, keyed by `kind`: `session` maps to the `5h` window, `weekly_all` to `7d`, and `weekly_scoped` to a per-model `7d` window named by `scope.model.display_name`. The legacy `five_hour`/`seven_day` fields are only a fallback; `seven_day_sonnet`/`seven_day_opus` are no longer populated by Anthropic. Unrecognized limit kinds and Anthropic's rotating internal code names (`nimbus_quill`, `tangelo`, ...) are ignored rather than guessed at.
- **Extra usage** is reported as the `extra_usage` window from `spend`, only while `spend.enabled` is true, with a money `valueLabel`.
- **Rate limiting**: Anthropic returns 429 aggressively. The last successful usage payload is cached in memory and reserved during a cooldown (`Retry-After`, else five minutes, capped at one hour). The cache is keyed by a hash of the access and refresh tokens, so switching accounts drops it instead of showing the previous account's numbers.
- **Runtime parity**: Web/Electron and VS Code preserve the last successful Claude values during the same bounded 429 cooldown. Quota dispatchers also coalesce concurrent refreshes for the same provider in each runtime, while requests for different providers remain parallel.

## Add a new provider (quick steps)
1. Choose module shape based on complexity:
   - Simple providers: create `packages/web/server/lib/quota/providers/<provider>.js`.
   - Complex providers (multi-source auth, multiple API calls, non-trivial transforms): create `packages/web/server/lib/quota/providers/<provider>/` with split modules like Google (`index.js`, `auth.js`, `api.js`, `transforms.js`).
2. Export `providerId`, `providerName`, `aliases`, `isConfigured`, and `fetchQuota`.
3. Use shared helpers from `packages/web/server/lib/quota/utils/index.js` (`buildResult`, `toUsageWindow`, auth/conversion helpers) to keep payload shape consistent.
4. Register the provider in `packages/web/server/lib/quota/providers/index.js`.
5. If needed for direct use, export a named fetcher from `packages/web/server/lib/quota/providers/index.js` and `packages/web/server/lib/quota/index.js`.
6. Update this file with the new provider ID, module path, and alias/auth details.
7. Validate with `bun run type-check`, `bun run lint`, and `bun run build`.

## MiniMax M3 / Token Plan migration

In 2025/2026 MiniMax rebranded "Coding Plan" to "Token Plan" alongside the M3 model release. The API underwent breaking changes:

- **Endpoint fallback**: The provider tries `/v1/token_plan/remains` (M3) first, falling back to legacy `/v1/api/openplatform/coding_plan/remains`.
- **Field semantics**: On the `token_plan/remains` endpoint, `current_interval_usage_count` returns **remaining** quota (not consumed). The provider computes `used = total - remaining` for this endpoint. The legacy `coding_plan/remains` endpoint retains the old semantics (`usage_count = consumed`).
- **Percentage-based plans**: Legacy Coding Plan accounts return `current_interval_total_count: 0` but include `current_interval_remaining_percent`. The provider prefers this field when count fields are absent.
- **model_remains array**: Now contains entries for multiple model categories (chat, speech, video, image). The provider selects the chat-model entry by matching `MiniMax-M*`, then `general`/`chat`/`text` by name, then any entry with a remaining percent.
- **Window status**: The `current_interval_status` and `current_weekly_status` fields indicate whether a window is active. Status `3` means the window is not applicable for the current plan tier (e.g. legacy plans without weekly limits). The provider omits inactive windows.

## ClinePass quota semantics

ClinePass reads `data.limits` from its usage-limits endpoint. Web/Electron and
VS Code accept only known window types with finite numeric or non-empty numeric
string percentages. Invalid windows are skipped independently; no usable windows
is a failed refresh, not zero usage. Both implementations choose a non-empty
`key`, then `token`, and expose auth/fetch dependencies for focused tests.
Saved UI provider-visibility lists remain authoritative; installations without a
saved list include ClinePass through the provider registry.

## Charm Hyper balance semantics

`GET https://hyper.charm.land/v1/credits` returns a team's current Hypercredit balance, not a percentage or reset timestamp. The [Hyper FAQ](https://hyper.charm.land/faq) defines one Hypercredit as $0.05. Both runtimes expose `credits_balance` in dollars and `credits` as a numeric label under the UI's localized window title. Keep English unit text out of that numeric label.

Web and VS Code accept finite numeric balances and non-empty numeric strings. Missing, blank, or malformed balances remain explicit failures; zero is valid. Credential lookup uses a non-empty string `key`, then `token`, so malformed or blank keys cannot mark the provider configured or hide a valid fallback token. Hyper fetchers accept `readAuth` and `fetchImpl` dependencies for tests without replacing filesystem or auth modules.

## Kimi for Coding field semantics

`GET https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1/usages` is inconsistent about which field carries consumption:
- The weekly `usage` block returns `used` (consumed) with no `remaining` field.
- Each `limits[].detail` rate-limit block returns `remaining` (available) with no `used` field.

Credentials resolve in alias order, first match wins. OpenCode's China plan id `kimi-code-plan-cn` (kimi.com) comes before the pre-split `kimi-for-coding` and `kimi` ids, because a leftover pre-split key can hold a dead credential that would otherwise shadow the live China plan key and return 401. The global plan id `kimi-code-plan-global` (kimi.ai, API base `api.kimi.ai`) stays last: it is not verified that a global key works at the `api.kimi.com` usage address, so it must not outrank a working pre-split key.

The provider computes `usedPercent` from whichever of `used`/`remaining` is present (`used` takes precedence when both exist) rather than assuming one field name. Both `packages/web/server/lib/quota/providers/kimi.js` and `packages/vscode/src/quotaProviders.ts` (`fetchKimiQuota`) must stay in sync — the VS Code extension duplicates this parsing logic rather than importing it.

## Ollama Cloud settings-page shapes

Ollama Cloud authentication uses two cookies (`aid` and `__Secure-session`) pasted together as one single-line Cookie header value. Ollama serves two different `/settings` page shapes and `parseOllamaSettingsHtml` supports both: session/weekly/premium-interaction windows (percent-based plans) and a `monthly` window derived from "Monthly usage: $X of $Y used" (cost-based plans) with a symmetric `$X / $Y` money `valueLabel` that reads correctly in both used/remaining display modes. The "Extra usage" credits block is surfaced as a balance-only `credits_balance` window with a plain money `valueLabel` when present, matching the Codex/DeepSeek credits treatment ("Credits Balance" in the UI); a $0 balance is omitted instead of showing an empty credits row. Keep `packages/web/server/lib/quota/providers/ollama-cloud.js` and `packages/vscode/src/quotaProviders.ts` (`parseOllamaSettingsHtml`) in sync — the VS Code extension duplicates this parsing logic rather than importing it.

## GitHub Copilot quota semantics

GitHub Copilot usage exposes only the `premium_interactions` snapshot as the
`premium_interactions` window. Shared UI labels that window **AI Credits** and treats it as
the provider's primary usage marker. Legacy chat-request quota and unlimited
completion quota are intentionally omitted. Keep
`packages/web/server/lib/quota/providers/copilot.js` and
`packages/vscode/src/quotaProviders.ts` in sync.

The `/copilot_internal/user` endpoint is undocumented; its quota semantics mirror
what `microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat` consumes (`CopilotUserQuotaInfo`). Each
snapshot carries `entitlement`, `remaining`, `unlimited`, and
`percent_remaining`. Providers must honor these rules:

- `unlimited: true` renders a percent-less window with an "Unlimited" value label.
- Percent math requires a positive `entitlement`; entitlements of `0`, `-1`, or null are unusable.
- When entitlement/remaining are unusable, fall back to `100 - percent_remaining`.
- Snapshots other than `premium_interactions` (legacy annual plans) yield zero windows.

## OpenRouter key semantics

OpenRouter quota reads `GET <base>/key`, where `<base>` is the provider's configured `baseURL` (`settings.baseURL`, legacy `options.baseURL`, or legacy `api`, folded by `toProviderEntity`; the v2 `providers.openrouter` entry wins, and the v1 `provider.openrouter` entry is read when the v2 one sets no address) read from the merged opencode config layers; with nothing configured or a config read failure, `<base>` falls back to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`. A gateway user's key is only valid against that gateway, so the usage lookup must ride the same base as chat. The default endpoint `GET https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/key` is documented as callable with any valid API key. `GET /api/v1/credits` is documented as "Management key required" and is not used. Calling `/credits` with a normal inference key has been observed to return HTTP 200 with `{total_credits:0, total_usage:0}` rather than an error; this behavior is not documented and is why the old implementation silently rendered "$0.00 left · $0.00 spent". A `/credits` fallback for unlimited keys would render the same zeros, so unlimited keys report `usage_monthly` instead.

The documented `limit`, `limit_remaining`, and `limit_reset` fields are present and null on unlimited keys; null means unlimited, never missing data. For a limited key, window usage is `limit - limit_remaining`, not `usage`: `usage` is all-time and measures a different axis from the current reset window. Pairing `usage` with the current limit produces a wrong number. `limit_remaining` is server-computed and already honors `include_byok_in_limit`, so `byok_*` fields are ignored.

Unlimited keys report `usage_monthly` in a `monthly` window with no percent. `limit_reset` is a period string (`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, or null), not a timestamp; `resetAt` is derived from the documented midnight-UTC boundaries, with weeks starting Monday. A set `limit` with a null `limit_reset` is a lifetime cap and maps to the `credits` window with no reset.

Keep `packages/web/server/lib/quota/providers/openrouter.js` and `packages/vscode/src/quotaProviders.ts` in sync, as with the Kimi and Copilot providers; the VS Code extension duplicates this parsing logic rather than importing the web provider.

## Zhipu AI Coding Plan semantics

`GET https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/monitor/usage/quota/limit` reports business failures inside HTTP 200 bodies (`{code, msg, success: false}`; an invalid token yields code 401 with `msg` "令牌已过期或验证不正确"). Providers must validate the envelope (`success === false` or a `code` other than 200) and return the failure with `msg` instead of parsing an empty `data.limits`; a missing envelope is treated as legacy success.

The limit type was renamed from `TOKENS_LIMIT` to `CREDIT_LIMIT` with unchanged `unit`/`number` window semantics: unit 3 marks hourly blocks (`5h`), unit 6 weekly. `CREDIT_LIMIT` entries carry `usage` (total), `currentValue` (consumed), and `remaining`, surfaced as a credit `valueLabel`; when `percentage` is absent the used percent is derived from `currentValue/usage`. `data.level` (for example `lite`) becomes `planLabel`. `TIME_LIMIT` stays the monthly `MCP Tools` window. Keep `packages/web/server/lib/quota/providers/zhipuai-coding-plan.js` and `packages/vscode/src/quotaProviders.ts` (`fetchZhipuaiCodingPlanQuota`) in sync.

## Notes for contributors
- Keep provider IDs stable; clients use them directly.
- Avoid adding alias-based dispatch in `fetchQuotaForProvider`; dispatch currently expects exact provider IDs.
- Keep Google behavior changes isolated and review `providers/google/*` together.
- Z.ai Coding Plan exposes separate 5-hour and weekly token/credit limit entries plus a monthly `TIME_LIMIT` for MCP tools. The API renamed the limit type from `TOKENS_LIMIT` to `CREDIT_LIMIT` (same `unit`/`number` window semantics); `CREDIT_LIMIT` entries additionally carry `usage` (total), `currentValue` (consumed), and `remaining`, surfaced as a credit `valueLabel`, and the payload's `data.level` becomes `planLabel`. Web and VS Code must preserve these windows and stay in sync.
- Z.ai gift (bonus) resets come from a supplementary `GET https://api.z.ai/api/biz/customer-package-reset/list?targetType=PERSONAL` with the same bearer token, fetched after a successful quota fetch. `expireTime` strings (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`) are parsed as UTC+8. Only `available: true` records with a numeric `recordId` and a parseable, non-expired `expireTime` are considered; the nearest expiry wins and is attached as `giftReset` (`{recordId, expireAt}`) on the window matching `windowSeconds` (`fiveHourResets` → 5h, `weekResets` → weekly). Expired records are never shown. The request is supplementary: any failure, non-ok response, or malformed payload leaves the quota result untouched with no `giftReset`. Activation goes through `POST /api/quota/:providerId/gift-reset/use` (z.ai aliases only), which posts `{targetType: 'PERSONAL', resetType, recordId, requestId: <uuid>}` to `https://api.z.ai/api/biz/customer-package-reset/use` (`resetType` is `'FIVE_HOUR'` for the 5h window and `'WEEK'` for the weekly window — the weekly value was verified live against a real weekly reset). Both runtimes must keep this in sync.
