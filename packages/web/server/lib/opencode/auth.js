/**
 * READ-ONLY view of OpenCode's provider credentials, shared by the web server
 * and the VS Code extension host.
 *
 * OpenCode 2.x owns every credential. Since 2.0.20 it hands them back over
 * `GET /api/credential`, secrets included, so the quota providers, voice keys
 * and routing read what the running OpenCode actually uses. Each call asks
 * OpenCode; concurrent callers share one request. A failed read throws rather
 * than answering `{}`: "OpenCode is unreachable" must not look like "the user
 * has no keys".
 *
 * A key OpenCode picks up from an environment variable (`ZAI_API_KEY`, ...)
 * is never stored, and that route does not list it. `GET /api/integration`
 * names the variable a connection came from, but not its value. When
 * OpenChamber launched OpenCode itself it knows the environment it passed, so
 * the source reads the value from there; an external OpenCode runs with an
 * environment of its own, and its variable keys stay unknown. A stored
 * credential wins over a variable, which is the order OpenCode itself uses.
 *
 * The answer keeps the legacy `auth.json` entry shape the consumers were
 * written against: `{ type: 'api', key }` / `{ type: 'oauth', access, refresh,
 * expires, accountId?, enterpriseUrl? }`, keyed by integration id, which for
 * providers is the provider id. Nothing here writes.
