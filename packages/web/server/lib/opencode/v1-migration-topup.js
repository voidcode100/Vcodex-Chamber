/**
 * Re-arms OpenCode's own V1 -> V2 session migration for sessions that were
 * created after it already finished.
 *
 * OpenCode 2.x migrates the legacy `session`/`message`/`part` tables into
 * `session_v2`/`session_message` once and then writes `{"phase":"completed"}`
 * under `migration.v1-v2` in `kv`. Users who kept running OpenChamber's
 * bundled OpenCode 1.x beside a v2 install created more V1 sessions after that
 * point, and OpenCode never looks at them again: they are simply invisible in
 * v2. This module hands OpenCode a resume cursor before OpenChamber spawns the
 * MANAGED OpenCode, so OpenCode's own `run()` imports them on startup with its
 * own transform. OpenChamber never writes session rows itself.
 *
 * Two hard rules, both verified against v2.0.8
 * `packages/core/src/database/v1-migration.bun.ts`:
 *
 * 1. NEVER delete or clear the `migration.v1-v2` row. With no row at all,
 *    OpenCode treats the database as pre-migration and DELETEs the whole
 *    `event` table — v2's durable event log — before starting over.
 * 2. NEVER schedule a cursor that makes OpenCode revisit a session which has
 *    seen v2 activity. Every visited session gets its `session_message` rows
 *    deleted and replaced by the V1 transform, so a migrated session that was
 *    continued in v2 would lose that conversation.
 * 3. Only 1.x activity since the last completed import triggers a new one.
 *    A v2 delete removes the `session_v2` row but leaves the legacy `session`
 *    row behind, so "missing from v2" alone would bring deleted sessions back
 *    on every start. A legacy session counts as missing only when its
 *    `time_updated` is newer than the completion stamp OpenCode writes on
 *    `migration.v1-v2`: only OpenCode 1.x writes that table, so an unchanged
 *    table means nobody ran 1.x since and the top-up skips. Decided by the
 *    maintainer (2026-09-24). When 1.x was used again, OpenCode still walks
 *    every id below the cursor, so a deleted session sorting below a fresh one
 *    comes back with it; that needs an import route taking an explicit list.
 *
 * The loop OpenCode runs is `SELECT id FROM session WHERE id < cursor ORDER BY
 * id DESC LIMIT 1`, one session at a time, so the cursor has to be strictly
 * greater than the largest id we want imported. Session ids encode time
 * descending in a fixed-width field that wraps, so id order is NOT time order:
 * a 2026-08 session can sort far below a newer one. Everything here compares
 * ids the way SQLite does (BINARY / memcmp — neither `session.id` nor
 * `session_v2.id` declares a collation) and never assumes id order means age.
