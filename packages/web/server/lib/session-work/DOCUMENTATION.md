# Session work ("In work")

## Purpose

Keeps sessions where real work is going on in one block at the top of the
sidebar until the user marks them done. Jev moves a session in when work
starts in it; the user alone closes it. The same turn-end Jev call tells
session assist whether the Small Model is worth waking.

## Files

- `questions.js` — the Jev questions (measured wording, see "Measurement"),
  the thresholds, and the decisions taken from the answers.
- `state.js` — `metadata.openchamber.work` and the merge patches that change
  it. Every patch is decided against the record at write time.
- `runtime.js` — `createSessionWorkRuntime`: `processPayload` (a sent message,
  a turn start), `evaluateTurnEnd` (called by session assist), `stop`.

## State

`metadata.openchamber.work`:

- `state`: `open` | `done`
- `openedAt`, `openedBy` (`jev` | `user`)
- `doneAt` once the user closed it
- `suggestDoneAt` while Jev thinks the last turn closed the work out

The UI parser is `packages/ui/src/lib/sessionWorkMetadata.ts`; the user's own
Track / Done go through the generic metadata route
(`setSessionWorkState` in `packages/ui/src/sync/session-actions.ts`), which
also exists in VS Code.

## Invariants

- Jev only opens. Nothing here ever writes `done`.
- Jev reopens a closed session only for a request sent after the user closed
  it (`openByJevPatch` compares the request's `time.created` with `doneAt`).
- Writes go through `updateSessionMetadata`, which decides the patch inside the
  store's per-session write queue, so a user's Done written a moment earlier
  is seen and kept.
- A turn-end check is bound to its turn: every turn start and new user
  message advances a per-session counter, and the done hint is written only if
  the counter is unchanged when the write runs (decided inside the store's
  queue). A late Jev answer about a turn the user already moved past writes
  nothing.
- The done hint is current while `suggestDoneAt >= session.time.idle` (the
  assist's freshness rule). This runtime also deletes a hint it wrote when the
  next turn starts; the rule covers hints written by another process.
- Only top-level, unarchived project sessions that are not review sessions
  (`openchamber.kind === 'review'`) are asked about. Managed Chats (under the
  `chatRoots` the server passes in) are plain conversations and never in work.
- A known subsession costs nothing: `../session-lineage.js` remembers which
  sessions have a parent (from `session.created` events and from any record
  read anyway), and a known one is skipped before any read or Jev call.
- Every failure (no classification provider, Jev error or timeout, an
  unreadable session) leaves state unchanged and returns an unknown gate, so
  session assist runs exactly as it did without Jev.

## When Jev is asked

- A user message was sent (`message.updated`, role user, from the hub's
  translation of `session.inbox.enqueued`): only with the feature and auto-open
  on, a usable classification provider, and the session not already in work.
  History is the three settled turns before it (`loadSettledTurns`). Each
  message id is asked about once.
- A turn ended: session assist calls `evaluateTurnEnd` before it arms its quiet
  window. One call carries only the questions that apply: the open questions
  while not in work, `wrap_up` while in work, `recap` / `next_step` for the
  assist fields the user has on. No applicable question, no call.

## Measurement

156 real sessions (93 work, 50 not, 9 housekeeping, 4 neutral) set the wording;
190 older held-out sessions, labelled before looking at answers, checked it:
send and turn end together missed 4/92 work sessions and opened 10/78 non-work
ones (four of them discussions of concrete changes, which count as work). The
misses are work that starts inside a PR-review session. `wrap_up >= 0.8`
reads the whole turn (a commit, push, merge, sync or release the answer
reports done closes the work); on the held-out sessions it hinted 80 times
across 106 work sessions, 22 of them followed by more edits, and caught 53 of
81 shipping steps. At 0.85 the same wording hinted 70 times (18) and missed a
closing turn whose answer asked the user for a last check (0.82); the earlier
request-only wording at 0.85 hinted 60 times (16) and caught 33.
`recap` stayed high (0.86–0.96) after a closing "thanks"/"commit" that followed
real work, because it reads the same three turns the recap does. Do not change
the wording or thresholds without re-running this measurement.

## Settings

`sessionWorkEnabled` (the block and the actions, default on) and
`sessionWorkAutoOpen` (Jev opens sessions, default on; not offered in VS Code,
and inert without a classification provider). Both are read at every use.

## Runtime parity

- Web, desktop, hosted mobile, Capacitor: all of it; the server owns Jev.
- VS Code: no OpenChamber server, so no Jev and no done hint. The block and
  Track / Done work through the extension's metadata bridge.

## Tests

`state.test.js` (patches, reopen rule, hint lifecycle), `runtime.test.js`
(send-time open, no repeat asks, ineligible sessions, the combined turn-end
call, a late answer after the next turn started, never closing, failure as
unknown), plus the gate cases in
`../session-assist/runtime.test.js`, `loadSettledTurns` in
`../session-assist/context.test.js`, and `updateSessionMetadata` in
`../openchamber-sessions/session-metadata-store.test.js`.
