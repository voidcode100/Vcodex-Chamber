 * there is one (a message from the UI, a scheduled task, a session the agent
 * dispatched) and re-sent on its own after compaction, when there is no message
 * to attach it to. The decision is the same in every case, so it lives here
 * rather than in each sender — the client used to own it, which meant sessions
 * started without a UI got nothing at all.
 *
 * What was delivered is recorded in the session's own metadata rather than in
 * the browser. A signature held in a tab is lost when the tab closes, and worse,
 * it survives compaction: the tab goes on believing the agent still has context
