const CONTROL_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = "When the user gives you an issue or a change under review (a pull or merge request) to work on, fix, investigate or review, when you open one for this work, and when the work resolves one, link it to this session with session.link as soon as you know it, so the user sees it with the session. Not one merely mentioned in passing. Also controls OpenChamber projects, sessions, and scheduled tasks on the user's behalf. Sessions and scheduled tasks you create are for the user to follow and interact with. Do not decide on your own to hand parts of your current task to another session; when the user asks you to create a session, send a prompt to one, or schedule a task, do it, including when the work relates to your current task. Use one action per call. Scope with projectId or directory; omit both to use the current session directory. Session dispatches return immediately by default and you receive no notification when a dispatched session finishes, so never promise to report back on it; the user follows it in OpenChamber; a dispatched session needs no follow-up from you. If the user later asks how it went, use session.messages (add wait to block until it is idle, lastAssistant for just the final answer) — session.send always sends a NEW prompt and never just waits. Set wait only when the user asks or the next step requires the completed result. Session and worktree deletion are unavailable.";

const WEB_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = "Look at and interact with a web page in OpenChamber's browser panel, so you can check your own work rather than describing what you expect. Use one action per call. Open a page, snapshot it to read its text and its interactive elements, then click, type or scroll using the selectors the snapshot returned; snapshots also report any errors the page logged. Pass a selector to browser.snapshot to read one part of a long page. browser.inspect returns computed styles when the question is how something renders. Set viewport to check a layout at mobile, tablet or desktop size. The page runs with the user's real logins, so treat what you see as their live session.";

const MEMORY_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = "Keep what you learn across sessions, so the user does not have to explain the same thing twice. Use one action per call. The session already lists the titles of what is stored. A title is an abbreviation, not the memory: read the entry with memory.read once before acting on it (it then stays in your context; do not re-read it on later turns), because titles leave out the conditions and exceptions that decide how the memory applies, and the ones that look self-explanatory hide them most often. Save something only when it will still be true in a later session — a stable preference, a project convention, a decision and its reason, or a hard-won pointer. Do not save one-off task state, anything you can read from the code, secrets or credentials, or anything the user asked you not to keep; when the user explicitly asks you to remember something, save it, unless it is a secret or credential. Choose the scope deliberately: global is about the user and reaches every project, so put a project's conventions in project scope. Save in the moment, without asking first, when the user corrects how you work or states a preference, confirms that a non-obvious approach worked, or when you learn a project fact that took real effort to find. One fact per entry. The user can review and remove what you save, so save when it fits and mention it briefly.";

const NOTIFY_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = "Send the user a notification through OpenChamber, so they learn about something without watching the session. Use it when you finish work that took long enough for the user to step away, when you are blocked on something only the user can resolve, or when the user asked to be told about something. Do not use it for routine progress, for every finished step, or to repeat what your reply already says to a user who is present. Keep the title short and put detail in the body.";

/**

 * the caller depends on.
 *
 * OpenCode 2 takes a tool's `input` as plain JSON Schema, so the generated file
 * needs no imports at all — which it must not have, because OpenCode loads the
 * entrypoint with a bare dynamic import and nothing resolves from the generated
 * directory.
 *
 * The action schema carries `oneOf` only. A node combining `enum` and `oneOf`
 * is valid JSON Schema, but some OpenAI-compatible gateways reject it and
 * answer with an empty completion instead of an error, and the `oneOf` branches
 * are what carry the per-action descriptions the model reads.
