/**
 * The mobile composer's pill ↔ full-composer state machine.
 *
 * With the keyboard closed the composer collapses into a narrow pill; any
 * interaction expands it back. The swap commits synchronously and, in the
 * native iOS shell, plays as a FLIP morph timed to the keyboard
 * (mobileComposerMorph.ts), while the transcript glides on the same curve
 * (keyboardFollowGlide.ts), so keyboard, composer and chat move as one
 * motion rather than a staircase.
 *
 * Most of the code here is not the state machine itself but the corrections
 * that keep it from fighting the platform: mobile browsers dismiss the
 * keyboard on a tap before the click lands, iOS refuses programmatic focus
 * outside a gesture, WebKit leaves the layout viewport panned after the
 * keyboard hides, and overlay chains hand off through a frame where nothing
 * is open. Every timeout and flushSync below marks one of those, and none of
 * them is verifiable outside a real device.
