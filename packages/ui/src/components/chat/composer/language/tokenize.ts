/**
 * One pass over the composer text producing every highlight range.
 *
 * The composer used to derive its highlighting from six independent memos in
 * ChatInput.tsx — markdown, fenced-code syntax, mentions, slash tokens,
 * snippet tokens and attachment citations — each re-scanning the same string
 * and each having to be remembered when a new construct was added. This is the
 * single entry point: give it the text and what the composer knows about the
 * workspace, get back the ranges.
 *
 * It is also the seam the editor renders through. The mirror overlay consumes
 * these ranges via `buildHighlightParts`; a CodeMirror view maps the same
 * ranges to decorations. Adding a construct to the language means adding it
 * here, once.
