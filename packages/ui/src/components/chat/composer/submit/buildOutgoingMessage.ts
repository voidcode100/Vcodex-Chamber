/**
 * Assembling what the composer actually sends.
 *
 * A single send can carry more than what the user just typed: messages queued
 * while the previous turn ran, inline review comments, `@file` references
 * resolved to attachments, linked issues and PRs, synthetic parts from
 * conflict resolution, and the skills mentioned inline.
 *
 * OpenCode takes one primary message plus additional parts, so all of that has
 * to be flattened into that shape — and the flattening has rules that are easy
 * to get wrong and impossible to see when they are spread through a 400-line
 * handler. They are stated here, as a pure function over injected resolvers,
 * so the ordering can be tested rather than trusted.
