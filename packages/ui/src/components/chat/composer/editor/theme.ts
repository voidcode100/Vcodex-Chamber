/**
 * Outside CodeMirror's iOS branch, devices keep `drawSelection()` but show the
 * NATIVE selection through it, for two independent reasons:
 *
 * - Their selection drag handles (the draggable pins after a double-tap)
 *   attach to the *visible* native selection, and `drawSelection()`
 *   hides it with `.cm-line ::selection { background: transparent
 *   !important }`, so the handles never appear and range selection is
 *   undiscoverable.
 * - The painted selection layer sits *behind* the content, so any token with
 *   its own background — inline code, code fences — covers it completely and
 *   the selection is invisible inside those spans. The native selection
 *   paints over element backgrounds.
 *
 * Dropping `drawSelection()` entirely is NOT an option, on any platform:
 * without it CodeMirror clears the `nativeSelectionHidden` facet and starts
 * enforcing cursor association on the native selection while typing in
 * wrapped text — programmatic selection moves that iOS answers with severe
 * input lag (each one also resets the keyboard's autocorrect context). Typing
 * must stay on the drawn-selection code path; only the paint changes.
 *
 * CodeMirror's iOS branch does NOT use this arrangement —
 * `composerIOSSelectionExtension` below explains why.
 *
 * Both rules below fight `drawSelection()`'s own `Prec.highest` theme, so
 * they carry `!important` and one class more specificity
 * (`.cm-content .cm-line` vs its `.cm-line`) to win regardless of style
 * mount order. The painted selection layer is hidden rather than removed —
 * two highlights would otherwise stack.
