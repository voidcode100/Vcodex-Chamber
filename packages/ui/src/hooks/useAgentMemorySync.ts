/**

 * opened Project notes sent every message with no memory index at all — the
 * agent had memories it was never told about.
 *
 * The session directory is resolved to its project first. A session in a
 * worktree has the worktree's path, and loading by that path reads a store the
 * agent does not write to, which is the same mismatch in the other direction.
