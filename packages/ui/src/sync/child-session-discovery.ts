 * Pick the children a discovery listing adds to a directory store.
 *
 * The listing asks the server for active children only, but it is a plain
 * request with no ordering against local mutations: a response that left the
 * server before the user archived a parent still carries the children without
 * `time.archived`, and adding them back would show them as active orphans until
 * the next refresh. The global sessions cache learns about an archive before
 * the archive action resolves, so a child it already lists as archived is a
 * stale copy and is dropped here. Credit for spotting the race: #2580.
