# Sync architecture, event handling & store update rules

## Scope

This document covers the current client-side session/data architecture in `packages/ui/src/sync` and the rules for updating stores safely.

There are **two distinct session data scopes** in the UI:

1. **Directory-scoped sync stores**
   - Owned by the sync layer child stores created in `sync-context.tsx`
   - Source for per-directory live session/message/part/permission/form state
   - Backed by SSE / directory-scoped polling
   - Read via hooks like `useSessions()`, `useDirectorySync()`, `getSyncSessions()`, `getDirectoryState()`

2. **Global sessions cache**
   - Owned by `packages/ui/src/stores/useGlobalSessionsStore.ts`
   - Shared source of truth for the Sessions sidebar global lists and Session Retention cleanup
   - Holds:
     - global active sessions
     - global archived sessions
    - active and archived entities indexed by ID
    - active root, parent/child, and directory indexes

These two scopes are intentionally different, but they are no longer equal peers for live UI truth.

### Why both exist

The directory-scoped sync stores are **not** a complete global view.

- They are created lazily per directory
- They only contain data for directories initialized in the current app session
- They are optimized for live per-directory domain data
- They do not maintain the complete global active+archived session view needed by the sidebar and retention settings

So:

- Use the **directory sync stores** for per-directory live session/message state
- Use the **global sessions store** for cold/global session coverage (especially archived pages and unopened directories)
- Use **aggregated child-store sessions and the global live status index** for live truth across initialized directories

## OpenCode compatibility before bootstrap

The desktop/web/VS Code App entry and MobileApp entry mount
`OpenCodeCompatibilityGate` before application initialization and SyncProvider.
Electron first asks the native host for the embedded managed CLI preflight.
It shares the lifecycle's pending or successful version check, so the gate starts
the app without another version request and without waiting for server health.
The verdict is scoped to the current API endpoint and is never persisted.
All other cases use the OpenChamber-owned `/api/opencode/compatibility` endpoint;
it does not depend on a healthy OpenCode server or successful session bootstrap.
Native mobile connection selection remains outside the gate until a server is selected.

A confirmed incompatible version keeps the application unmounted, removes the
HTML splash, and shows recovery immediately. There is no session/event polling
behind that screen. Unknown versions and failed compatibility reads hand control
to the existing connection recovery instead of claiming the CLI is v1.
Runtime changes invalidate pending results and require a fresh check.

Recovery offers the host's `canInstall` capability as Update to OpenCode v2.
The install action uses `/api/opencode/install-v2` and waits for installation,
version verification, and restart before reloading the UI. Check again refreshes
a confirmed incompatible version without reporting an operation failure or restarting.
Failed or unavailable checks preserve the known incompatible state and show an error.
When v2 is confirmed, Check again invokes the existing `/api/config/reload`
runtime operation before reloading the UI.
Failures keep the recovery screen visible with retry and the installation guide.
Bundled OpenCode points to an OpenChamber update; external runtimes and Windows
use manual installation. Host-side rules enforce the capability independently
of button visibility.

## Ownership map

| Layer / Store | Owns | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `ChildStoreManager` and child directory stores | Priority-scheduled directory bootstrap plus `session`, `message`, `part`, `permission`, `form`, etc. | One runtime and one store per directory |
| `SessionMessageLoader` | Initial message loading, pagination, prefetch, retries, load state, and optimistic reconciliation | One runtime, directory, and session ID |
| `global-session-status.ts` | Incremental non-idle session status index reconciled from events and authoritative directory snapshots, plus a reference-stable active-ID membership collection maintained from the same mutations | All known directories in the active runtime |
| `session-ordering.ts` | Ephemeral lifecycle rank used by every user-visible session list | All known sessions in the active runtime |
| `session-activity-timing.ts` | Elapsed time of the running turn and of the turn that just finished, plus the persisted starts that survive a reload | All known sessions in the active runtime |
| `session-ui-store.ts` | Session selection, draft lifecycle, one-shot draft-materialization transition identity, abort prompts, worktree metadata, SDK-facing action entrypoints | App UI state |
| `useGlobalSessionsStore.ts` | Global active/archived entities plus root, parent/child, and directory indexes | All opened project/worktree session lists |
| `viewport-store.ts` | Scroll anchors, session memory, loading indicators | App UI state |
| `attachment-files.ts` | Attachment picker allowlists, MIME/content validation, structured-text sanitization, and HEIC conversion | Local chat attachments across shared UI runtimes |
| `document-attachments.ts` | Bounded Office/OpenDocument extraction, document text serialization, embedded-image extraction, and positional citations | DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, ODT, ODP, and ODS chat attachments |
| `input-store.ts` | Draft input state, attached files, synthetic parts, pending guest attach, destination-scoped fork replay handoff | Attachments and fork replay target runtime + directory + session; other pending input is app UI state |
| `selection-store.ts` | Model/agent/variant selections | App UI state |
| `voice-store.ts` | Voice state | App UI state |

Local chat attachments are normalized by `attachment-files.ts` before entering `input-store.ts`. PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, and PDF retain their media type; HEIC/HEIF is converted to JPEG; recognized text/code formats and unknown files whose first 4 KB are text are sent as `text/plain`; binary files outside the supported media types are rejected. Jupyter notebooks become readable markdown with non-text outputs omitted. HAR credentials, cookies, and sensitive URL parameters are redacted, while request/response body text is omitted. SVG and Draw.io files are attached as source text, not executable/rendered content. Browser and VS Code pickers expose the same allowlist, while drag-and-drop may still accept an unknown extension after content inspection. Large plain-text clipboard pastes can become in-memory `text/plain` attachments named `pasted-context-N.txt` through the composer paste path; they use the same normalization and send pipeline as manually attached `.txt` files.

Office and OpenDocument packages are metadata-validated before asynchronous extraction, with limits of 20 MB compressed input, 5,000 archive entries, 25 MB per entry, 8 MB per XML part, and 100 MB total uncompressed content. Unsafe or non-canonical archive paths reject the whole attachment, and only XML, relationship, and supported image entries are decompressed and retained. Extracted text, including its explicit truncation notice, is bounded to 500,000 characters so compact but dense Office files cannot consume an entire model context window. XLSX dense rows are serialized as quoted TSV under a single source range instead of repeating every cell address; highly sparse rows retain explicit cell coordinates so distant cells do not generate vast empty TSV spans. Confirmed Office/OpenDocument `@file` mentions are loaded through the runtime filesystem route before submit and use this same extraction pipeline instead of being forwarded as `text/plain` `file://` parts that OpenCode rejects as binary. A failed mention load or extraction leaves the composer intact, and a runtime switch discards preparation from the previous runtime. At most 50 signature-validated PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP images and 40 MB of image bytes are retained, with a 20 MB per-image limit; unsupported, invalid, omitted, and truncated content remains explicit in the extracted text. Images whose citations fall beyond text truncation are not attached. Extracted document content remains a `text/plain` file attachment with the original document filename, rather than becoming visible user-message text. Supported embedded images become separate image file parts; the extracted text contains `[filename]` citations at the source paragraph, slide object, spreadsheet cell anchor, or OpenDocument text position. Generated image filenames are re-evaluated if the composer changes during asynchronous preparation, avoiding collisions. The store publishes all generated parts atomically only after every data URL is ready.

The composer compares normalized attachment MIME types with the selected model's declared input modalities. It warns when a newly attached file or an existing attachment after a model change requires an unsupported modality, but does not block sending. Missing modality metadata remains unknown and does not produce a warning.

Attachment drafts stay in memory for the page's lifetime, including composer remounts, independently of text persistence. `selectAttachmentDraft` saves the outgoing list and restores the rendered composer's runtime, directory, and session before paint. Switching cancels unfinished attachment reads. Send and queue recovery pass their captured draft identity so a late failure restores files to the source rather than the currently open session. Clearing or deleting a draft releases only its files. Opening a new-session draft leaves the outgoing session's files available for a return visit.

## Catalog changes apply live

OpenCode v2 watches its own config files and rebuilds agents, commands, skills,
MCP servers and plugins by itself, announcing each rebuilt slice
(`config.updated`, `agent.updated`, `command.updated`, `skill.updated`,
`plugin.updated`, `credential.*`). `events.ts` translates all of them into one
`catalog.updated` sync event carrying a `kind`, and `reloadCatalog` re-reads
that slice. The event carries the location OpenCode rebuilt, so for the project
being worked in it arrives through that directory's reducer (`onCatalogUpdated`)
rather than the global branch; both schedule the same reload. Nothing in the UI asks the user to apply or restart anything: the
only setting OpenCode cannot pick up on its own is which binary runs, and
Settings → OpenChamber → OpenCode CLI owns that restart.

One saved file produces a burst of events, so the kinds are collected and
re-read once the burst settles (250 ms). A `config` rebuild first clears the
client's config cache, otherwise the refresh would be answered from the copy
cached seconds earlier. A re-read that returns an identical list keeps the
objects already in the stores, so nothing re-renders.

**The model list.** OpenCode 2.0.8 removed the `catalog.updated` storm and
replaced it with `provider.updated` and `model.updated`, which it publishes
only when the list they name actually changed; `events.ts` translates them into
the `provider` and `model` catalog kinds. The config change that declares a
provider in `opencode.json` and a credential change (a login or logout) still
trigger a re-read as well, because OpenCode recomputes those two snapshots from
integration and credential events only: a provider plugin that fetches its
models from the provider after a login (Copilot, LM Studio) lands later and
announces nothing. That is why the Settings and composer stores read the list a
second time `PROVIDER_REREAD_AFTER_CREDENTIAL_MS` after a credential change.

| Kind | Sync child stores | Settings/composer stores (`stores/catalogRefresh.ts`) |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | `agent` per directory | agents store + config-store agents |
| `command` | `command` per directory | commands store |
| `skill` | — | skills store + skills catalog |
| `plugin` | — | plugins store |
| `config` | `config` and `provider` per directory (plus `emitSyncConfigChanged`) | agents, commands, skills, MCP config, plugins, config-store providers |
| `provider` / `model` / `credential` | `provider` per directory | config-store providers (model-metadata cache invalidated; the current list stays until the new one lands; `credential` reads twice) |
| `project` | global project list | — |

## Compaction records

A compaction is one `compaction` message. `session.compaction.started` inserts
it as `running`; `session.compaction.delta` appends to its `summary` while
OpenCode writes it (the event names only the session, so the reducer finds the
newest running compaction itself); `session.compaction.ended` / `failed`
settle it. The settled event carries no input id, so the reducer keeps the
running record's id and creation time instead of adding a second record, the
way OpenCode's own message store does. The timeline notice shows the summary
as it grows and collapses it behind a toggle once settled.

## A location's services going away

OpenCode caches the service graph that serves a directory and drops it after
an hour of inactivity, or when something asks it to reload. It announces that
as `location.shutdown` for the directory. Session records and messages live in
OpenCode's database and stay valid; the live state read from that graph does
not, so `handleEvent` bootstraps the *selected* directory again (reason
`location-shutdown`, forced) instead of patching it. Background directories are
deliberately left alone: re-reading them would recreate the services OpenCode
just evicted and turn every idle directory into an hourly refresh loop. They
are re-read when selected or on the next `server.connected`. The pending
permissions and forms OpenCode rejected on the way out and the turns it
interrupted arrive as their own events.

## Committing a revert

A staged revert is a marker (`session.revert.messageID`); the transcript
keeps the reverted messages and hides them. Reverting or forking from a user
message cuts at the first of the synthetic context carriers right before it,
so the marker can name a carrier: the carriers leave with their message
instead of riding along with the next prompt, and the reverted user message is
the first user message at or after the marker. Sending or compacting past the
marker commits it: OpenCode deletes the boundary message and everything after
it in one `session.revert.committed` event, with no `message.removed` per
record. `events.ts` translates it into a `session.revert.committed` sync
event, which the reducer applies by trimming messages and parts from the
boundary and dropping the marker in one step, followed by the plain
`revert: null` patch the global session list needs. The loaded window is
always the transcript's tail, so a boundary the window does not hold is
older than everything loaded: the reducer empties the window when the store's
own marker names the same boundary and leaves it alone otherwise. A local send
past a revert has already trimmed optimistically, so the event is a no-op for
it; a commit from another client is applied by the event alone. Every commit
also invalidates the session message loader, including a commit that changes
no visible records. This retires in-flight reads, clears deleted optimistic
shadows and prefetch coverage, and prevents an older response or the next empty
fetch from restoring deleted messages. The remaining visible records stay in place
while the loader establishes fresh coverage. Their optimistic shadows remain
until an authoritative snapshot confirms them.

## An interruption whose reason is `shutdown`

`session.execution.interrupted` carries a reason. `user`, `inactivity` and
`superseded` end the turn: the session records an `interrupted` outcome and
settles idle, which also runs the local interrupted-turn marking below.
`shutdown` is OpenCode itself going away mid-turn; it keeps the execution
claim and resumes the drain after restart, records no outcome and leaves the
assistant message open. The translator emits nothing for it, so the session
stays as it was until the reconnect status snapshot or the watchdog poll
reports the authoritative state.

## Session list rules

Opening a new draft applies its configured model identifier immediately, then
reconciles after project config activation. That continuation belongs to the
same runtime and draft object and yields to a manual choice made while loading.
The config store owns default selection and discovery-gap behavior, documented
in `packages/ui/src/stores/DOCUMENTATION.md`.

Changing a draft's project or switching between Project and Chat applies the
target's agent, model, and effort defaults immediately. Worktree refinement
within the same project preserves manual choices. Activation continuations
check the runtime, draft identity, target revision, and manual-selection state
before applying defaults again.

`selection-store.ts` persists runtime/session-keyed effort overrides alongside model and
agent choices. Both a named effort and explicit `Default` survive reload, with
the same 150-session persistence bound as the existing selections. Old payloads
without effort entries remain valid; malformed effort entries grant no authority.
Session deletion clears these entries. A saved effort choice precedes older
message history so a reload cannot undo an unsent picker change.

### Layout-mounted session-list lifecycle

`MainLayout` and `VSCodeLayout` each call `useSessionListSync({ isVSCode })` directly and unconditionally, outside Sidebar visibility, responsive, editor, settings, and compact-view branches. The hook selects the real topology inputs, publishes complete directory bootstrap demand through `ChildStoreManager`, refreshes topology additions (including all VS Code directories on its first mount), coalesces OpenChamber control events for 500ms, and supplies a memoized complete global active+archived input to authoritative cleanup. The root-level global poller owns the initial global refresh. MainLayout includes available worktrees; VS Code intentionally excludes them. Sidebar-local `session-created` worktree discovery is separate and full-app-only.

### Directory bootstrap scheduling

`ChildStoreManager` is the single owner of directory bootstrap scheduling. Consumers publish demand; they must not start bootstrap from row mount effects.

- The scheduler runs at most two directory bootstraps concurrently.
- Selected session/current directory demand outranks active-project, expanded, visible, and background demand.
- Demand is deduplicated by normalized directory and can be promoted while queued.
- `useSessionListSync` is the only bootstrap-demand owner, and it publishes only the current directory and the selected session's directory. Known projects and worktrees are never bootstrapped for being known, shown, expanded, or restored as expanded: their rows and sessions come from the global session list, their live activity comes from the global status index, and their pending requests come from the cross-directory blocking-request index. On v2 every directory-scoped read makes OpenCode create and initialize a location, so publishing the whole topology created one location per project at startup. Sidebar notices still request bootstrap manually with `force`.
- A directory that was never bootstrapped relies on the global list for sidebar readiness. Until a complete global snapshot arrives, its group shows loading or a retryable global failure. A directory bootstrap can establish active-list coverage for its own scope; it cannot establish archived coverage. Directory access and initialization failures remain scoped to directories the user selects.
- A system-resume signal, including Capacitor foreground resume, refreshes pending forms and permissions only for the active materialized directory. The refresh is deduplicated while in flight, preserves existing state on fetch failure, and leaves unopened directories untouched; normal stream reconnect recovery remains the broader catch-up path.
- When a materialized current turn contains a pending/running form tool but that session's pending form record is missing, the mounted chat performs a form-only recovery scoped to that session. It tries at most three times with delays of 0, 500, and 1,500 ms, stops when the chat unmounts or changes sessions, and guards every attempt against runtime changes. This closes cold-start races without adding requests to ordinary session opens or scanning unrelated sessions and directories.
- A bootstrap holds its scheduler slot only through the authoritative directory session-list fetch. `bootstrapDirectory` returns separate `sessions` and `environment` completions. `getBootstrapState` describes list loading; `getInitializationState` describes configuration and recovery. A complete empty list stops its spinner even while initialization is running. Initialization failure keeps the list and exposes its own retryable notice, including native directory access when the filesystem confirms a permission failure.
- Directory initialization uses v2's global active-session snapshot and directory-scoped form, permission, config and location reads. Form and permission reads ask only the directory's own list, one HTTP request each. v2 has no global pending list: a read without a directory answers for OpenCode's working directory (the user's home for a managed OpenCode) and starts that location, MCP servers included, so pending-request lists are never read without one. Live recovery starts independently of configuration and optional enrichment. Each successful read publishes its own fields; a failed read preserves prior data. Optional enrichment failure is logged without failing the workspace's core initialization. MCP status and the command list are deliberately not read during bootstrap: reading MCP state initializes that directory's entire stdio server fleet as an OpenCode side effect, and listing commands enumerates MCP prompts, which touches the same state. The MCP and command surfaces fetch on demand through `useMcpStore` and `useCommandsStore` instead, and slash-command dispatch falls back to one live lookup before treating an unmatched name as a plain prompt. OpenCode connects a location's MCP servers asynchronously, so a status read just after the location started says `pending`; each `mcp.status.changed` it announces re-reads that directory's status (debounced per directory), and only for a directory whose status is already held.
- Session pages and background reads share a three-request budget, with at most two running in either lane. Background work cannot consume the third slot, leaving capacity for lists even when two background reads stall. Queued lists take precedence over background work; active-session status recovery outranks queued metadata within the background lane. Retry backoff holds no network slot. Independent background reads can still progress concurrently.
- Session pagination retries each failed page at most three times. The directory loader does not replay the whole list after those attempts, so one unavailable page cannot multiply retries or redownload earlier pages while holding its scheduler slot. The VS Code empty-success recovery remains separate.
- A mounted directory-store consumer pins that store for its lifetime. Eviction may dispose only unmounted directories, so optimistic actions and realtime events cannot move to a replacement store while visible React consumers remain subscribed to an older identity.
- Selected, active-project, expanded, and visible bootstrap demand also protects a store from eviction. This keeps virtualized off-screen directories alive while their owner still needs them; background demand remains evictable so the complete known topology does not make the cache unbounded.
- Reconfiguration and runtime switching invalidate stale generations. A stale completion must not publish state into the new runtime.
- Failure is recorded as `failed`; it is not converted into a successful empty snapshot. Forced demand can retry failed or completed work.
- A failed bootstrap is classified as `os-permission` only when the owning runtime filesystem API independently confirms `EPERM`/`EACCES` for that exact directory. OpenCode/proxy error text is never used as permission evidence. The scheduler retains the directory-scoped reason so local Desktop can offer native folder selection before a forced retry.

Bootstrap remains stale-while-revalidate: a directory store may paint persisted sessions immediately, but only a successful authoritative fetch may replace that cached list.

`directory-recovery-snapshots.ts` overlays status and blocking-request events received during initialization reads, including repeated busy events that do not change store references. Replies and session deletion/archive prevent stale responses from resurrecting pending requests or activity. Direct local mutations also survive the merge. These observers exist only for in-flight reads and belong to the exact directory-store identity. Initialization commits retain the bootstrap generation and attempt guard after the list scheduler releases its slot; retry, disposal, and runtime changes reject old completions.

Only archive events accepted by the reducer affect recovery snapshots. A rejected stale archive cannot erase current pending requests. Status snapshots pass through the shared schema in `lib/opencode/session-status.ts`; null, arrays, and malformed entries cannot grant idle authority. The scheduler's scope guard includes the runtime key and SDK identity, so invalidation takes effect before React replaces the provider. Reconfiguration reschedules initialization that outlived an already-complete list rather than leaving it stranded.

Global status reconciliation takes known session IDs only from records owned by the queried directory. A project store may contain worktree sessions; a parent-directory snapshot must not settle those sessions in the global activity index.

Directory session lists record whether their current snapshot is empty, persisted, live-event-derived, or authoritative. Bootstrap captures a mutation revision before starting its requests. Its completion replaces persisted data, including with a successful empty response, then overlays only session events and direct move/archive/delete mutations newer than that revision. It must not preserve the entire cached list as a race fallback because that would retain stale persisted sessions.

The roots request is authoritative for root completeness. The broader child-session request has independent completeness: a successful empty response clears stale children, while a failed request preserves known children and their required ancestors without turning the failure into an empty snapshot.

The persisted session snapshot keeps up to 50 sessions selected by `time.updated`/`time.created`, not ID ordering. On read, every cached record is parsed for the fields the stores dereference before bootstrap (`id`, `directory`, `projectID`, `title`, `time.created`/`updated`) and records that fail are dropped: localStorage on `openchamber-ui://app` is shared by every OpenChamber build, so a record another version wrote is untrusted input, not a `Session`. Non-empty updates coalesce to the latest runtime-directory snapshot and flush on lifecycle suspension; runtime switches reject stale pending writes. Successful empty results persist an empty v2 tombstone synchronously so legacy data cannot reappear on restart. If localStorage quota prevents the full snapshot, persistence retries with progressively smaller recent snapshots and removes stale current/legacy values rather than leaving an old list indefinitely.

### Directory-scoped session list

Use the directory-scoped sync store when the UI needs the live session list for the **current directory**.

Examples:

- current chat/session switching
- per-directory session/message bootstrap
- session/message/part SSE updates

Directory bootstrap must publish a closed session hierarchy: when a child is
returned before the roots query catches up during cold startup, retain or
recover its referenced parent instead of exposing an orphan-only snapshot.

Session message loads use runtime, normalized directory, session ID, SDK epoch, and loader generation as commit authority. Eviction, archive, delete, move, directory disposal, and runtime switching invalidate the applicable loader generation before stale in-flight work can publish. A move invalidates both source and destination loader targets.

An authoritative `session.deleted` event also clears persisted UI state before routing metadata can be removed. Confirmed local deletion and accepted `404` deletion do the same directly instead of depending on the event echo. Cleanup is identity-owned by runtime, normalized directory, and session ID: queued messages, persisted todos, composer drafts, per-session input-history buckets, inline-comment drafts, and pins clear only that tuple, while the active runtime's folder store removes the session from every active or archived folder scope. Stale-runtime events and unresolved/global directory identities do not mutate persisted state.

Persisted sidebar state is never reconciled destructively from the first successful startup list. That list establishes an authoritative active+archived baseline. Only a session present in that baseline and omitted from a later complete snapshot is treated as a missed external deletion, and that judgment commits the same reconciliation as a confirmed deletion through `reconcileExternallyDeletedSession`: the session leaves every live store and the global cache, the current-session pointer clears when it pointed there, and `cleanupPersistedSessionState` runs. Clearing only persisted state was the earlier behavior, and it left the session in every live store, in the sidebar, and as the open chat still prompting an id the server no longer has when the `session.deleted` event was lost. The reconciliation is rechecked against the captured runtime before it mutates the non-runtime-scoped live, global, and UI stores. Archive and directory moves retain the session ID across snapshots and are not deletion cleanup. The judgment runs in `MainLayout` and `VSCodeLayout` through `useSessionListSync`, which see a snapshot every 45-second global poll, and in the mobile shell's `MobileAppContent`, which has no poller and sees a snapshot whenever the sessions sheet opens or the last session is restored. This favors harmless hidden stale metadata over irreversible user-state loss when startup data is incomplete.

Session materialization recency is keyed by runtime and directory. Foreground loads promote navigation recency. Prefetch reserves only unused per-directory capacity before HTTP starts and inserts speculative entries behind visited sessions. A prefetch cache hit does not promote recency, and a full cache skips uncached speculation. Otherwise the sidebar's neighbor prefetch displaces visited sessions and causes repeated HTTP on every navigation cycle near the limit. Prefetch pagination metadata has a global count ceiling and is removed with session eviction, directory disposal, loader runtime reconfiguration, and loader disposal.

`SessionCacheRetention`, owned by `SessionMessageLoader`, evicts whole session histories and never trims them. A cached transcript is either fully present or gone. A settled session nobody is looking at keeps its history for a five-minute idle grace and is then dropped, so a quick return needs no request while a long-abandoned session frees its messages, parts, and derived caches. Twenty materialized sessions per directory on web/Electron and six on VS Code, hosted mobile, and Capacitor are a soft safety net: past that count the least recently visited unprotected session is evicted immediately. Selected or externally viewed sessions, busy/retrying sessions, pending forms/permissions, optimistic sends, in-flight loads, explicit history readers, and the transcript still rendered through a deferred switch are protected and may overflow the limit. Protection ending restarts the idle grace from that moment.

Selection changes and directory message/status/blocking-request publications schedule one coalesced retention pass per directory, and one timer per directory wakes the pass when the earliest idle grace expires. Part-only streaming updates do not schedule retention. Switching runtimes and disposing directories cancel the old cleanup ownership. Eviction resets the loader entry and marks it evicted: messages that later arrive by event for that session are renderable but are not history coverage, so the next navigation fetches the transcript again and merges it with those events instead of presenting them as the whole history.

Cold navigation and prefetch request 100 records (50 on constrained surfaces) and, when that page holds fewer than ten user prompts, extend it backward through the server cursor one page at a time until ten prompts are present, history is complete, or the window holds 300 records (200 constrained); nothing already downloaded is requested again, and the window publishes once. History readers such as export need only one prompt boundary. Interactive history loading requests 100 older records per action; if the batch does not start on a user prompt it reads up to two more whole pages, keeps every fetched record, and stops. The server cursor stays authoritative, the batch publishes once, and a failed follow-up read preserves the previous history and cursor. Overlapping demands share that batch. Programmatic prepend compensation and the settling guard cannot trigger another batch. On desktop an underfilled pinned viewport requests one batch per opened session; the load-older button remains available on every runtime while coverage is incomplete. Explicit complete-history readers use 100-record pages until complete without turn alignment. Exports and title-context reads hold a loader history lease until their result has been copied out.

### Global session list

Use `useGlobalSessionsStore` when the UI needs a **shared global session cache**.

Each full app root owns one global polling lifecycle through
`useGlobalSessionsPolling`. The web/desktop root and VS Code chat root load once
when mounted and schedule the next refresh 45 seconds after completion, so
sessions created by another OpenCode process are discovered without relying on
the sidebar or native tray being visible. Before the first successful global
load, failures receive at most three earlier retries after 1, 2, and 4 seconds;
then the normal cadence continues. Store error status, including a chats-root
lookup failure, drives recovery because the loader returns retained data on
failure. Runtime changes retire the old timer and start a fresh load immediately;
late completions cannot restart the old timer or seed the new runtime.
Embedded chats do not poll.
The sidebar and tray consume the same store and must not start their own
full-list timers. Surface-specific refreshes, such as opening the mobile session
sheet or returning from suspension, may still request freshness at their
explicit lifecycle edge; the store coalesces an overlapping in-flight load.

**Isolated spaces.** With the feature on, the first global page carries the
host's `spaces` mark: one entry per space with its name, the state of its last
answer (`complete`, `partial`, `stale`, `unknown`), the registered project it
was made for and its directory inside. `lib/spaces/spaces-store.ts` keeps the
marks of the last complete load, reset on a runtime switch. A space's sessions
live at `/spaces/<id>/<folder>`; `lib/spaces/space-route.ts` turns that
directory into the `/api/spaces/<id>/` prefix at call time, and `runtimeFetch`
applies it from the directory a request names in the open, so the sidebar's
per-directory reads of a space go to the space. Rules that follow from the
mark: a session of a space whose answer was not `complete` may be missing from
the snapshot without being deleted, so the authoritative cleanup skips it; the
event pipeline hands the host's `openchamber:space-stream` announcement to
`sync-context.tsx`, which marks a lost stream as stale and, when it is back,
re-reads that one space's directories with `refreshSessionsForDirectories`,
whose answer marks the space reachable again. The active-session snapshot that
settles an unfinished turn is the host's, global, and never covers a space, so
`getActiveSessionStatuses` asks a space directory's own server for it; the
host's empty answer would otherwise mark a turn running inside as interrupted.
A space that dies in the middle of a turn sends no settle event, so the
session keeps the busy state it last reported until the space answers again
or the user acts; the group's stale mark is what says the space is gone, and
the group's status line turns it into "not answering" with a restart of the
container (`lib/spaces/space-repair.ts`). That module derives the line from the
journey entry (`state`, `damage`), the mark, and the one action this window has
under way or saw fail on the space, which `spaces-store.ts` keeps per space and
clears on a runtime switch. After a start or restart that went through it marks
the space reachable, because the host answers those only once the server inside
is ready, and it reads the journey list again whatever the outcome. After a
removal that went through it also reloads the global session list: the mark of
the removed space goes only with the host's next complete list, and until then
the sidebar kept an empty group for the space, about forty seconds measured.

The host also announces each step of a creation as
`openchamber:space-progress`; the pipeline hands it to `sync-context.tsx`, which
moves the space's entry in `spaces-store.ts` on. That store also keeps the
journey route's list, the only source that knows a space still being made or
one whose making failed, read on every (re)connection while the switch is on:
a step announced after a read began wins over that read's answer, and a read a
runtime switch overtook is dropped. The sidebar shows a group for every space
of either list (`useSidebarSpaces`). VS Code never applies
the prefix and never shows a space (decision 16 of the design).

Not done here: the session-keyed actions still fall back to the current
directory when nothing confirmed the session's own, in `session-actions.ts`
and inside the SDK wrapper's `clientFor`. A guess that names the wrong side is
refused by the server's guards or answered not-found by the far side, which
cannot act on a foreign id, so nothing crosses the boundary; the action fails
where it used to succeed by luck. Making those actions fail before the request
is a later stage.

### Session retention

`session-retention.ts` owns eligibility and cleanup execution;
`useSessionAutoCleanup.ts` connects it to the app and Settings. Manual and
automatic runs share a lock acquired before loading. Each run requests a fresh
complete global snapshot and refuses the loader's error/fallback state. A
runtime switch stops the batch and prevents writing its cooldown into the new
runtime. Automatic attempts are limited to once per day while the app is open;
manual runs bypass the cooldown and enabled checkbox.

Retention targets unarchived sessions by last activity by default. The opt-in
`sessionRetentionOnlyArchived` setting switches both the preview and execution
to archived sessions and measures their retention period from `time.archived`.
It forces Delete in the store and cleanup runner; Archive is disabled in Settings.
Turning it off leaves Delete selected and makes Archive available again. The
setting uses the instance settings registry across web, desktop, VS Code and mobile.

Both modes preserve the five most recent sessions in the selected scope, ranked
by that scope's retention timestamp, plus the selected session, shared sessions,
and sessions with observed live activity. Parents with an attached `/btw` conversation also stay,
because the canonical archive/delete actions remove that temporary fork.
Sessions outside the selected scope remain protected. Because
OpenCode cascades deletion, every ancestor of a retained session is protected
too. Eligible deletions run children first and recheck current selection,
activity, sharing, age, and child membership before each request. A failed child
blocks deletion of its ancestors while unrelated sessions continue.

Cleanup uses the canonical archive/delete actions, including confirmed `404`
deletion, persisted-state cleanup and runtime guards. Settings shares the run
state and shows loading or fetch failure separately from an eligible count.

### Live cross-directory session/status view

Extension session subscriptions project these same stores through `lib/guests/workspace.ts`; they own no poller or git discovery. `global-session-status.observedById` retains explicit live activity/outcomes for at most 2,000 sessions in memory. A status snapshot can establish current activity but does not manufacture a successful turn. An error followed by idle retains its failed outcome until another run starts; runtime reset clears observations. Extension task status remains extension-owned.

The session creation action accepts `navigation: "preserve"` for background extension launches. It still registers the returned directory, initializes message loading, marks the session as OpenChamber-created, and updates the global cache, but never selects it. Explicit guest `openSession` performs selection later. `session-ui-store.worktreeDiscoveryByProject` publishes topology loading/ready/error separately from retained worktree records; the existing sidebar discovery and control-event refresh own these flags.

Use the sync hooks backed by aggregated child stores when the UI needs **live truth** for sessions or statuses across all initialized directories.

Current consumers:

- `SessionSidebar.tsx`
- `SessionNodeItem.tsx`
- `Header.tsx`
- agent/session activity surfaces using `useGlobalSessionStatus()` / `useAllSessionStatuses()`

Cross-directory selectors subscribe to the narrow child-store field they aggregate. Session aggregation listens to `state.session`. Live busy/retry state is also maintained in `global-session-status.ts`, where each row subscribes to one session ID instead of scanning every child store. Events update the index incrementally; authoritative per-directory status snapshots seed it, clear sessions omitted as idle, and reconcile missed events. Unrelated streaming events such as `message.part.delta` must not trigger global session/status scans.

Directories that are not bootstrapped get their initial activity from the host instead: `host-session-status-seed.ts` fetches `/api/sessions/status`, the cross-project map the OpenChamber host keeps from its single upstream event stream, after each global session load. One request, no OpenCode instance creation. The seed is additive only. It adds busy entries (retry collapses to busy; the next live event restores details) for sessions the client has not observed itself, resolves each session's directory from the global session cache, skips entries the host last updated more than 30 minutes ago because nothing reconciles the host map after a stream gap, and never clears anything: the host payload carries no directory, so absence proves nothing. A live event that arrived first wins. In VS Code the webview shim answers the same route from the extension host's activity watcher, whose phases collapse busy and retry and settle themselves, so every entry it reports is current. The remaining gap is intentional and runtime-specific: on desktop with an external OpenCode, a turn that started before the OpenChamber host and has not emitted a status event since shows no dot until its next step.

Pending permissions and forms get the same treatment in `global-blocking-requests.ts`: the dispatcher feeds it `permission.asked`/`permission.replied`, `form.created`/`form.settled`, and `session.deleted` for every directory, and the host seed adds the `pending` map the server keeps from its own stream (`getPendingBlockingRequestsSnapshot` in `session-runtime.js`; dropped on reply, deletion, and OpenCode restart, so it carries no age cutoff). The index keeps only the fields its consumers render (`id`/`sessionID`/`action`/`resources` for a permission, `id`/`sessionID`/`title` for a form), which is also everything the host can carry. It is additive from the seed and never cleared by absence. Directory stores stay the source for open directories and for row badges; the index serves the tray's approval list and any surface without a mounted row.

A `permission.asked` in a session whose permission mode answers without the user (`auto`, or `safety` while a classification provider can run) is held back in `handleEvent`: no card, no row badge, no toast, so a request the server accepts never flashes on screen. The server reports a request it did not answer (the safety net held it, Jev failed, or the reply failed) as `openchamber.permission-left-for-user`; the held-back event is then replayed as an `ask` request, stored and announced, in a directory with or without a store. `permission.replied` drops a held-back request. A report that arrives before its request is remembered (bounded), and that request is shown at once. VS Code never holds back: its extension host answers in the webview. A request held back while the client disconnects reaches the store through reconnect reconciliation, which does not consult the mode.

In-app permission and form toasts for a directory without a store are shown from `handleEvent` directly, except in VS Code, whose extension host owns the auto-accept path. VS Code's `/api/sessions/status` shim reports no pending requests.

An MCP elicitation arrives as a `form.created` whose `sessionID` is the `global` sentinel (`LOCATION_SCOPED_FORM_SESSION_ID`): no session record exists for it, so event routing does not treat it as a session address — it is filed by its own directory tag and never enters the session routing index, otherwise a second directory's elicitation would land in the first one's store. The directory store keeps it under `form["global"]`, bootstrap's directory-scoped `form.list` returns it like any pending form, `useScopedBlockingForms` surfaces it from every session of that directory, and reply/cancel resolve the directory from the store that holds it.

Turn-complete and error notifications are recorded before the directory-store lookup in `handleEvent`, so an unopened directory still gets its unread dot. The subtask check reads the directory store when the directory is open and the global session cache otherwise. Event routing likewise consults the global session cache: a session-addressed event with no directory is routed to the directory the cache records for that session before any active-session or single-store fallback, so another project's events cannot land in the one open store.

Session display order is independent from streaming-frequency `time.updated` publications. `session-ordering.ts` promotes a session exactly when its authoritative activity phase crosses `settled` (`idle`/`error`) and `active` (`busy`/`retry`) in either direction. Repeated busy/retry or idle/error events are no-ops. The first authoritative status snapshot establishes a baseline without synthetic promotions; later snapshots reconcile missed transitions. Root sessions compare lifecycle rank only with other roots, while child sessions compare lifecycle rank only with siblings sharing the same `parentID`, so child activity never moves its root conversation. Pins remain the first ordering bucket. The timestamp/creation fallback is frozen when a session first participates in ordering, so later metadata-only updates cannot reorder it; creation time and ID provide deterministic ties. Runtime switches clear all phases, baselines, and ranks.

`session-activity-timing.ts` measures how long a turn has been running, because `SessionStatus` carries no timestamps. It is driven from the same two write paths as `global-session-status.ts`, so a row can never count a turn that index calls idle. A session gains a start on its first `active` observation and keeps it across repeated busy/retry events; settling converts that start into a finished duration, which rows show only while the session is unread and which is therefore never persisted.

A background subagent keeps its parent's turn open for display. The parent goes idle while the child session works and runs again when OpenCode hands the result back; `global-session-status.ts` therefore holds the parent's timer through that pause (an idle parent with a running descendant does not settle, the last descendant to finish settles it, and snapshots count ancestors of running sessions as active), and `useSessionTurnActive` is what every session row, tab and switcher reads as "running". `statusById` and `activeSessionIds` stay the session's own status: sends, cleanup and retention must not treat an idle parent as busy. The parent lookup comes from the global sessions store through `setSessionParentResolver`, wired by `sync-context.tsx`.

A background shell command keeps its session's turn open the same way. OpenCode settles a `shell` call with `background: true` at once, the session goes idle, and it runs again when the command's result is handed back. `background-shells.ts` indexes the commands OpenCode runs on behalf of a session (the shell tool tags each with `metadata.sessionID`): `shell.started`/`shell.ended` events keep it current for every directory, applied before status events in the same flush; a directory's `/api/shell` list is authoritative for that directory and is read by directory bootstrap and, on `server.connected`, for directories without a store that the index holds commands for. The list is keyed by the directory OpenCode answered for (symlinks resolved), which its shell events carry, and events that arrive while it is read win over it. A failed read changes nothing; a runtime switch resets the index and discards reads started before it. `useSessionTurnActive` reads this index too, the turn timer does not settle while a command runs, and the last command of an idle session ending settles it. The session's own status and the queue gate are unchanged: a dev server left running in the background must not hold queued messages.

Starts are persisted so a reload resumes the same count, but a persisted start is a lookup table and never a claim of activity. **Nothing in the protocol marks where a turn begins.** OpenCode calls `SessionStatus.set` with `busy` at every step of the agent loop and publishes an event each time, so a busy event means "still running", not "just started"; after a refresh one of those repeats normally beats the first status snapshot, so treating it as a turn boundary reset the counter on nearly every reload. Turn *ends* are marked — `session.idle` and `session.error` fire once, live, and retire the persisted record — while a snapshot that omits a session is not evidence of anything, since it may simply not see it yet.

That leaves the case with no observable answer: a turn that ended, and another that began, entirely while the tab was gone. Two bounds stand in for the evidence the client cannot have. A liveness stamp sits beside the start — refreshed while the session is observed active, at most every 15s, and stamped precisely as the page hides (`pagehide`/`visibilitychange`/`freeze`, written immediately rather than through deferred storage so it cannot lose that race) — and is compared against this page's `performance.timeOrigin`, so the measure is how long the app was absent rather than how long bootstrap took; a 20-second startup must not spend the allowance. Records may only be adopted within 90s of load, after which they are discarded — a backstop for a runtime whose event stream is down and where snapshots are therefore the only signal. A runtime switch resets the module, since the previous instance's turns are not ours.

Reconciliation walks the running turns and asks the snapshot whether it covers each one, rather than being handed everything the snapshot covers. Only a live start can settle, and there are a handful of those against a directory's hundreds of sessions, so the pass stays proportional to the timing work and allocates nothing per poll. Malformed, wrong-shaped, over-age, and future-dated entries are rejected on read. The payload is not runtime-scoped: records live for seconds and are keyed by instance-unique session IDs, whereas the runtime key is derived from injected globals and is not guaranteed stable across early startup — a read under a key the previous page never wrote to is indistinguishable from "no turn was running".

**Only the stamp expires a persisted start.** A snapshot that covers a session without reporting it busy is not proof the turn ended: bootstrap fetches status and sessions in parallel and directory scopes resolve at different times, so a snapshot legitimately arrives before it can see a running session. Treating one of those as a settle deleted the start moments before the real busy snapshot arrived, which reset every counter to zero on reload. Settles therefore act only on sessions that already have a live start in this page session.

Forks (`forked-session.ts`): OpenCode 2.x publishes only `session.forked` for a fork, with ids and no record, and no `session.created` follows. `handleEvent` reads the fork's record with `session.get` and replays it as a `session.created`, so other clients show the fork without a list reload. A session the global cache already holds (the forking client inserted it from the fork response) is skipped; a failed read or a runtime switch applies nothing.

Child-session discovery (`child-session-discovery.ts`) adds only children the global sessions cache does not list as archived: the listing asks for active children, but a response that left the server before an archive completed still carries them without `time.archived`, and re-adding them would show the just-archived subagents as active orphans until the next refresh.

The active-session watchdog in `sync-context.tsx` sends status recovery through the active-session priority of `runBackgroundNetworkTask`. Its child-session discovery pages use `runSessionListNetworkTask`, alongside global and bootstrap session pages. Both lanes live in `@/lib/background-network`. Git, skills, and directory initialization use the background lane. These limits reserve browser connections for interactive message requests rather than letting startup fan-out occupy the whole pool.

Reconnect and watchdog candidates come from non-idle status, the viewed session, or unresolved materialized messages and tool parts. Only ancestors of those candidates join recovery. Parentage in cached session history alone starts no status polling, child discovery, or message materialization; an idle directory with only cached metadata does not scan its history.

The watchdog calls the stream stale after 20 s without stream activity. Stream activity is anything the event pipeline receives, reported through `onStreamActivity`: an event, a WebSocket frame, or a keepalive that carries no event. OpenCode 2 sends its heartbeat as an SSE comment and the WebSocket bridge sends `openchamber:heartbeat`, and neither becomes a delivered event. Counting delivered events alone made an idle viewed session look stale, so the stream reconnected and resynced every 15 to 20 s, as reported in #4062. Starting a connection attempt is not activity, so a stream that receives nothing still goes stale.

Imperative cross-directory session lookups use the cached ID index from `getAllSyncSessionMap()`. The index is rebuilt only when a child store's `state.session` reference changes; permission lineage checks must reuse it instead of rebuilding a full session map per call.

VS Code does not run the server permission-auto-accept runtime. The extension host persists and broadcasts authoritative policy, while its foreground UI runtime resolves missing child-session lineage through the OpenCode API before deciding whether to suppress and answer a `permission.asked` event. Once policy is enabled, a live `permission.asked` event sends the directory-scoped `permission.reply` immediately and does not block on a permission-state preflight request. Enabling the policy treats permission cards already present in the directory store the same way and replies immediately, then reconciles the server's pending list by replying to listed requests directly without a permission-state preflight: `permission.list` is served by the V1 pending map while the state check reads the separate V2 map, so a preflight "resolved" verdict cannot prove a listed request settled. Reconnect/bootstrap reconciles pending requests in the session directory the same way, including requests inherited by child sessions. Unknown lineage and exhausted reply retries fail closed and leave the request available for manual action. A later `permission.replied` event invalidates any older deferred ask so the async policy check cannot resurrect a resolved request. With every OpenChamber webview closed or suspended no responder runs; this is an intentional VS Code limitation. Other runtimes remain fully server-owned.

### Mutation responsibility

`useGlobalSessionsStore` is kept correct by:

1. shared global fetch/reconciliation via `loadSessions()` / `refreshGlobalSessions()`
2. session create/update/delete events; recency-only updates for existing sessions are retained latest-per-session and committed once on `session.idle`/`session.error`, while structural updates and create/delete remain immediate and runtime switching discards pending updates. Display ordering reacts separately to active/settled lifecycle transitions, not to these recency publications
3. direct mutation from session actions after successful SDK calls:
   - create
   - title update
   - share
   - unshare
    - archive
    - delete
    - move to another worktree directory
   - retention cleanup batch archive/delete

This keeps cold/global lists responsive without requiring a refetch after every change.

Live activity/status indicators must not depend on this cache. They must use the event/snapshot-reconciled global live status index.

### Viewed sessions and surface attention

A `session.idle` or `session.error` for the selected session is recorded as viewed only while the user can see this surface; otherwise it raises an unread marker. `lib/surfaceAttention.ts` owns that answer. Web, desktop, and mobile use document focus; on web and desktop, `App.tsx` also marks the selected session viewed when the window regains focus. A VS Code webview document's focus does not track what the user sees: it loses focus whenever the code editor takes it while the chat stays on screen, and it can keep focus while VS Code is in the background. There the extension host reports window focus and webview visibility (`viewerStateChanged`); once a report arrives it replaces document focus, and `VSCodeApp` marks the selected session viewed whenever a report says the webview is seen again.

## Session message loading

The event pipeline's reconnect callback carries `replayReset`. A global WS
`ready` frame with that flag means the server's bounded replay suffix no longer
covers the client cursor. The pipeline clears that cursor and the sync provider
runs normal authoritative gap repair even during early boot. Ordinary reconnects
retain their existing startup grace period.

`SessionMessageLoader` is the shared authority for session message requests. Navigation, reactive chat loading, sidebar prefetch, pagination, reconnect/recovery, and optimistic reconciliation must delegate to it rather than issuing parallel initial requests.

Rules:

1. Request identity is runtime key + normalized directory + session ID. Session IDs alone are not globally unique across runtimes or directories.
2. One in-flight request is shared by all callers. Foreground demand may promote the visible load kind of an existing prefetch without starting another request.
3. Load state is explicit per session: `idle`, `loading`, `ready`, or `error`. Fetch failure preserves prior materialized records and exposes retry; it never becomes authoritative empty success.
4. Async commits are generation-checked. Runtime switches, forced refreshes, eviction, and disposal must reject stale completion.
5. Prefetch coverage and persisted directory data are runtime-scoped. Legacy persisted directory entries may seed startup continuity, but they are not live truth.
6. Message and part materialization preserves references for unchanged records and maintains direct message-to-parts lookup. Consumers subscribe to the selected session's records rather than broad message/part containers.
   Directory `sessionStatusReady` records successful status-snapshot authority independently of bootstrap's general readiness. Before that flag or an explicit session status arrives, telemetry treats an omitted status as unknown. Archiving invalidates status authority for that session alone: restoring it cannot inherit the directory's older snapshot as proof of idle. A live status event or a successful fresh status read clears the invalidation; a failed read leaves it unknown. Neither the flag nor invalidations are persisted.
7. Pagination demand must carry the selected session's effective directory. It must not fall back to the sync provider directory because the visible session may belong to another worktree.
8. The ref-stable loader is disposed only after the current task when its provider unmounts. This lets React Strict Mode's development setup → cleanup → setup probe retain a usable loader for child effects, while real disposal still invalidates the preceding lifecycle's work.
9. Transcript arrays are chronological by `message.time.created`. Within one millisecond a `synthetic` record sorts before any other role, then message ID breaks the tie deterministically: composer context is admitted right before its prompt, often in the same millisecond, while the prompt's ID is minted earlier on the client. Sends mint context IDs before the prompt ID and show those synthetic records optimistically with the prompt's timestamp, so the context renders on the prompt from the first frame and the server records reconcile in place. Message IDs are identity and reconciliation keys, not chronology: OpenCode's fixed-width sortable timestamp prefix rolls over, so a newer `msg_000...` can follow an older `msg_fff...`. Fetch, pagination, materialization, optimistic insertion, events, reconnect inspection, rendering, and revert/undo/redo must preserve this contract.
10. Session-scoped ArrowUp and ArrowDown recall merges the visible transcript's user prompts (`useUserMessageHistory`) with the persisted input-history bucket for runtime + normalized directory + session identity. Revert markers hide prompts from the transcript source only; the persisted bucket still recalls them. Global scope reads the persisted runtime bucket alone.
11. Part arrays preserve authoritative response/event order. Part IDs are identity keys and have the same rollover limitation; identity lookup/removal must not require a part array to be lexically ID-sorted.

A successful local session creation publishes its session record and calls `SessionMessageLoader.initializeCreatedSession` before selection starts navigation loading. The create response establishes an empty transcript only if no transcript has arrived yet. Initialization supersedes an earlier unresolved history load, preserves any messages or metadata received before the create response, and uses the server-returned directory. Opening that new session needs no history read; forced recovery and later eviction still use normal fetching. Creation responses from a previous runtime cannot select or initialize a session in the current runtime.

Initial loads use smaller requests on constrained VS Code/mobile surfaces and publish the cursor-extended ten-turn window described above. The mounted chat timeline requests one history batch when its pinned viewport is underfilled, when the user scrolls toward history, or when load older is pressed; mobile uses the explicit button. Timeline caches, pending work, prepend snapshots, and stale checks use runtime + directory + session identity so equal session IDs in different worktrees cannot share lifecycle state. Older pages are fetched through the same loader and merged with optimistic records before publication. The same chronology contract applies in the VS Code webview because it consumes this shared loader and sync store; the extension bridge must transport OpenCode records without introducing its own ID-based ordering.

## Failed-turn diagnostics

A `session.error` event is the only account of a turn OpenCode stopped, and
it can arrive with no assistant message to attach to. `session-error-log.ts`
keeps the last 20 of them in memory (`recordSessionError`, fed from the
event pipeline next to the error notification) and `summarizeOpenCodeError`
reads the `{ type, message }` structured error the event carries. The chat shows the newest
error for the open session under its last message while that turn is the
latest one (`SessionErrorNotice`), and also names a user message that an idle
session has left unanswered for five seconds, since an accepted send that
produced neither a message nor an error would otherwise look like nothing
happened. Before that no-reply notice shows, the session tail is re-read
from the server (the live stream may have dropped the reply); the notice
appears only if that read settles with the prompt still last, or fails. Two
more reads, at 10 and 30 seconds, keep running under the visible notice so a
late reply still replaces it. Both buffers — session errors and rejected sends — appear in the
status report (`buildOpenCodeStatusReport`, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+L or
`__opencodeDebug.statusReport()`) together with the managed OpenCode
process's last error and stderr tail and the expected log file locations.

## Loading diagnostics

Session loading instrumentation is disabled by default. Set `localStorage.openchamber_session_load_perf` to `"1"`, reproduce the interaction, then inspect `window.__openchamberSessionLoadPerformance.events`.

The bounded event buffer records only controlled bootstrap, message, and global-list operation/caller labels with queue/duration, outcome, retry count, and downloaded record count where applicable. Message-page events also record the requested limit and whether a cursor was present. When diagnostics are enabled, the selected chat records its first painted renderable message snapshot once per recent session identity and immediately clears the corresponding browser performance entry after emitting the trace mark. Canceled frames retain no measured identity, so returning to that session can schedule a replacement measurement; completed identity tracking uses the same 1,000-entry ceiling as the event buffer. Exported events never retain runtime keys, directories, session IDs, credentials, or message content. Initial-message expansion counts every downloaded page, not only the accepted page. The browser profiler independently validates the known labels and finite numeric fields before export. Instrumentation is diagnostic only; unit/type/lint checks do not replace production runtime profiling at representative project/session scale.

High-frequency sync diagnostics are separately disabled by default. Set `localStorage.openchamber_sync_perf` to `"1"` before reload to enable fixed numeric counters for pipeline traffic, reducer publications, streaming reconciliations, entries/messages visited, targeted heartbeat work, and persistence serialization/write volume. The hot path performs only a null check while disabled; counters never retain IDs, payloads, or user content.

Browser profiling also enables `localStorage.openchamber_stream_perf` to capture bounded aggregate timings and render counts for chat projections, message components, and major sidebar boundaries. These metrics contain no session IDs or user content and are reset immediately before each recording.

The profiler also emits a user-timing mark when pending global-session recency is committed at a lifecycle edge. `summary.json.longTaskAttribution` correlates that mark with enclosing long tasks without recording session data.

Streaming assistant and reasoning text is throttled once before reaching the markdown renderer. The renderer incrementally reconciles changed markdown blocks but does not add a second character-pacing timer, which would multiply parse/morph work while catching up on large streamed chunks.

The event pipeline delivers each ordered per-directory flush as one reducer batch. Events retain their individual notifications, cleanup, routing, materialization, and debug side effects, while directory mutations accumulate in order and publish one store transaction per touched directory. Global session mutations and live status, ordering, and timing transitions also accumulate in event order and each owner publishes at most once for the flush. Each top-level state slice is cloned lazily at most once in that batch; no-op events do not change references.

A sustained stream is flushed at most every 100ms (`FLUSH_FRAME_MS`); the first event after a quiet spell is flushed at once, so a lone permission or status event is never held back. The interval matches the 100ms at which streamed text is shown: each flush publishes the directory store and re-renders the streaming message, so a shorter interval pays for renders that change nothing on screen. Measure with `bun run profile:session` against the fixture provider before changing it.

Streaming lifecycle derivation has two paths. Directory attach, switch, bootstrap, and reconnect may perform a full reconciliation. Normal store publications reconcile only sessions whose `session_status` or `message` bucket changed; part-only events update the affected streaming message heartbeat directly and must not rescan all busy sessions.

A trailing assistant message that the server stamped `time.completed` is never marked as streaming: the stamp means the whole response (text plus every tool call) finished, so even while the session stays busy for the next step of the turn, the typing indicator and the streaming part-update suspension must not linger on finished content. The message-level streaming state (`streamingMessageIds` / `messageStreamStates`) is therefore a *message* lifecycle, not a turn lifecycle — it is completed by an explicit `time.completed`, by a newer trailing message, or by the session leaving `busy`.

When an assistant `message.updated` event carries `time.completed` and the store still believes the session busy, sync schedules one deferred status check (`maybePollStatusAfterMessageCompletion`, ~750ms). The status is re-read when the timer fires, so a normal turn whose `session.idle` lands inside that window issues no request at all; only a still-busy session spends a directory status poll, sharing the watchdog's one-in-flight-per-directory guard. The invariant is unchanged from the watchdog escalation: the monotonic pass confirms or raises active status and never lowers it, and an authoritative resync runs only when the snapshot disagrees with a store that still believes the session busy. This narrows the stuck-spinner window after a lost `session.idle` from a watchdog interval to one round-trip; the 5s watchdog poll remains the backstop.

Incomplete-session materialization is deduplicated by runtime, directory, and session for the full cooldown window, including after a fast success or failure. A settled-running-tool recovery may supersede a different request in that window so an earlier pre-settlement refresh cannot consume the only terminal recovery signal. Deferred recovery is dropped if its captured runtime is no longer active. If recovery requests a tail refresh while an older load is in flight, one refresh runs after that load instead of losing the newer authority demand. Completion retains the cooldown marker until expiry, and an older completion cannot clear a newer request marker. Recovery starts after the current ordered event batch and rechecks whether local state already contains the requested entity before starting HTTP. An explicit empty part bucket is authoritative fetched-empty state, not a missing snapshot. This prevents repeated orphan/missing-part events from creating message-tail and status request storms while preserving later recovery.

When `session.idle` or `session.error` settles a session but the trailing assistant message still contains a `pending` or `running` tool, sync refreshes that session tail. This narrowly reconciles a missed terminal tool-part event without refetching normally completed turns or stale tools from older turns. A stale refresh or delayed part event cannot regress a locally observed terminal tool to an active status.

A completed assistant message is authoritative for its own tool parts. During materialization, a `pending` or `running` tool under `time.completed` becomes `error`/`Interrupted` with an end time. This handles stale persisted tool state during reload. The merge preserves a terminal part already observed live, and a later terminal server snapshot can replace the local interrupted marker.

A turn is marked stopped only when OpenCode says it stopped: a `session.execution.interrupted` event (any reason but `shutdown`, which keeps the turn for resumption) or `session.execution.failed`, translated to `session.idle` with `outcome: "interrupted"` and to `session.error`, or, in loaded history, an `idle` record after the trailing assistant message whose outcome is `interrupted` or `failed` (`markRecordedInterruptedTurn`, run after every message load; the newest record after that message decides). The server does not always finalize the message and its parts before that record (anomalyco/opencode#19023), so with no pending form/permission and the session not running again, the unfinished assistant message is completed locally with an `aborted` structured error, including text-only turns and turns whose tools had already finished, and any active parts are finalized as `error`/`Interrupted` with an end time, so tool timers stop and cards render the error state. A later terminal event can supersede the mark, while a stale unfinished refresh cannot regress the locally finalized message or parts. Supersession is concrete: a `message.patched` that carries `time.completed` without an error drops the local `aborted` mark, and a server snapshot whose assistant record is completed replaces a record this client still holds open or marked. Nothing else marks a turn: not an idle status, a status snapshot that lowers or drops a session, a `session.idle` without outcome or with `succeeded`, nor an unfinished answer on its own. OpenCode keeps run state per process, so a turn another OpenCode process runs on the same database (the TUI, `opencode run`) reads exactly like that while it is still going (openchamber#4156). The cost is deliberate: a turn whose process was hard-killed (crash, force quit, power loss) has no record, because nothing ran to write it, and stays open until the session is stopped or continued. A plain `opencode serve`, which is what OpenChamber manages, does not sweep such turns on start; OpenCode's registered service mode does (`SessionRestart`).

Directory stores also own session-keyed sidecar notification channels for permissions, forms, and message materialization. Collapsed sidebar rows group their hidden descendants by owning directory and subscribe to the exact permission and form buckets; expanded rows subscribe only to their own buckets. High-frequency realtime part events annotate the exact session/message before committing, so visible records, user history, renderability, and sidebar permission and question rows are not notified by unrelated sessions. Structural message replacements notify only changed subscribed session buckets; unannotated bulk part replacement conservatively resets active message subscribers so bootstrap, pagination, rollback, and legacy writers cannot leave stale projections.

Message sidecar consumers also filter targeted updates by purpose before notifying React. Suspended live-tail text/reasoning changes do not rebuild visible message records, but structural Task session identity changes bypass suspension so a parent can link a newly created subagent immediately. Assistant-only part changes do not rebuild user input history, and targeted updates that preserve authoritative part buckets do not recheck a session that is already renderable. Message replacements, removed final part buckets, and conservative resets always notify.

## Session directory resolution

`session-directory-resolution.ts` owns the precedence used to answer "which directory does this session belong to". Every send, message fetch, message-queue key, and send-confirmation lookup is routed by that answer, so a wrong value is not a display problem: the prompt is posted against a directory that does not own the session, the request is rejected, and the optimistic message is rolled back with no visible error.

Precedence, highest authority first:

The discriminator is whether the server confirmed the path, not whether the value is local or synced.

| Source | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `authoritative` | The session record's own directory, then a child store that holds it |
| `selected` | Server-confirmed directory captured at selection; a guessed one is never passed |
| `attachment` | Worktree attachment recorded by this client; the *requested* path |
| `worktree-metadata` | Worktree captured when the session was created in one; the *requested* path |
| `remembered` | Per-runtime directory persisted across restarts |

Rules:

1. Ownership comes from the session record's own `directory`. When directory sync has no owning record yet, the global session index supplies that record's directory before local selection, worktree, or remembered hints. `getSyncSessionDirectory()` reports *containment*, not ownership, and is only the fallback for a record without a directory: a project's session list includes the sessions of its worktrees so the sidebar can group them, so the parent repository holds worktree sessions too, and reading ownership from membership routes a worktree session to its parent. `null` means "not indexed yet", never "no directory".
2. `attachment` and `worktreeMetadata` hold the worktree path this client asked for, before the server canonicalized it. They are a hint for a session sync has not indexed yet, never a correction of a confirmed directory — otherwise a stale local path re-creates the very mismatch this precedence exists to prevent.
3. Never persist or rank a guessed directory. `selectSession` may fall back to the active directory to keep routing usable, but that value is not written to runtime memory, not written to the last-active snapshot, and not passed as `selected` — a persisted guess outlives the race that produced it and survives reloads and restarts.
4. Components must not read `currentSessionDirectory` to build request or queue keys; use `getDirectoryForSession()` so every consumer resolves identically. `session-actions.ts` resolves the directory for rename, share, archive and delete the same way: the global record's own directory first, directory-store containment only as a fallback. A project root's store indexes status, permissions and questions for its worktrees' sessions, so containment there named the root for a worktree session and the server rejected the mutation with 404/500.
5. A disagreement between sources is logged once per session, and `__opencodeDebug.diagnoseSessionDirectory()` reports every source in precedence order.

## AI session titles

`use-session-ai-rename.ts` connects the shared menus to Small Model and the
existing title action. `session-title-context.ts` uses `SessionMessageLoader`
to page backward only until three completed user/final-answer pairs are covered.
Opening a menu checks eligibility on demand; row mounts do not load history.
The collector uses chronological records and assistant parent IDs, excludes
unfinished, failed, summary, synthetic-only and reverted turns, and retains
user-attached context even when its transport part is synthetic.

`session-title-generation.ts` owns runtime/directory/session-scoped pending
operations. Manual title saves cancel generation before sending their write.
Runtime changes abort pending generation, including a switch away and back.
After generation, a fresh session read rejects changed titles, directories,
archive state and revert markers before the normal title action saves. Failure
retains the old title and always releases pending state. The current OpenCode
title endpoint has no compare-and-set operation, so another client's write
after this final read cannot be guarded atomically.

`lib/messages/messageMarkdown.ts` formats attached quotes and user comments for
both title context and Markdown export. Export keeps full text; title input
limits individual fields and each message while retaining head/tail excerpts.
Web, Electron, hosted mobile and Capacitor use the existing Small Model route.
Mobile session rows expose the same action inside the manual rename editor
(swipe, then rename), with a session-scoped generation spinner on the row.
VS Code has no Small Model route and exposes a disabled action with an explicit
explanation.

## Session action rules

- Archive, restore and delete return booleans and id lists through the store contract shared by sidebar rows, the bulk bar and the mobile sheet. The reason behind a failure is recorded separately in `session-action-failures.ts` at the catch site and taken once by the surface that reports it, so the toast can quote the OpenCode status, error class and log `ref` (`OpencodeApiError` from `lib/opencode/client.ts`, which keeps `tag`, `detail` and `ref` from the tagged body) instead of a bare "failed". Rename fails loudly the same way and closes its form.

Session actions live in `session-actions.ts` and are the canonical place for SDK-calling session mutations that affect global session lists.

Rules:

1. If an action mutates session list membership or visible session metadata, update `useGlobalSessionsStore` there.
2. If an action targets a session by ID, resolve the **session's own directory**. Do not assume the current directory is correct.
3. `session-ui-store.ts` should delegate to `session-actions.ts` for these mutations instead of duplicating SDK calls.
4. Sending after a revert commits the new branch optimistically: remove the reverted tail and marker before inserting the new message, and restore both if the send is rejected.
5. Composer and queued sends carry their captured runtime, directory, and session through asynchronous preparation. A runtime change cancels the send instead of re-resolving it against the new runtime. Outside VS Code the queue itself is server-owned (`packages/web/server/lib/message-queue/`): the UI hands the server the captured send configuration, resolved text, attachments, and attached context at queue time and the server delivers on idle; the composer only sends a queued message itself after taking it back from the server (`takeForSend`). See the `messageQueueStore.ts` section in `stores/DOCUMENTATION.md`.
6. After session creation, the directory returned by the server is authoritative over the requested draft directory. The server may canonicalize a worktree path, and the first prompt must use the same directory identity as the created session.
7. Regular new-chat drafts that inherit the persisted current/last directory must not create a session against a confirmed-missing path. Fall back to the active project only when OpenChamber's directory stat reports the directory missing; keep explicit worktree targets, in-flight worktree creation, and unknown/offline probes unchanged, and do not persist the fallback until session creation succeeds. A concurrent draft rewrite to that same active-project fallback must not abort session creation.
8. A prompt send that fails **after** the request left the client is ambiguous, never a definite failure: the server may already be answering it. Transports tag those errors (`markAmbiguousTransportFailure` in `@/lib/relay/transport-error`; the relay tunnel tags every stream that dies with a request in flight), and `isAmbiguousSendFailure` reads the tag before falling back to status/text heuristics. An ambiguous failure waits for the connection to return, refetches recent messages, and confirms the optimistic message in place instead of rolling it back — rolling it back lets the message queue re-send a prompt the engine is already running, producing two independent AI responses for one user message.
9. `SessionLiveActivity` has three answers and `unknown` is never `idle`. `getSessionLiveActivity` reports `active` when any child store or the global session-status index holds a non-idle status. Idle requires an explicit idle event or a successful status snapshot in the session's owning directory. A loaded list, a parent repository containing the worktree session, or an omitted global active-index entry does not grant idle authority. Callers that gate a destructive action, such as worktree moves, must refuse on `unknown`.
10. Revert and unrevert cascade through known descendant sessions before mutating the parent. Revert uses the first descendant user message at or after the parent's target timestamp, including equal timestamps because message IDs do not define chronology. A descendant failure is logged and does not block its siblings or the parent. The parent runs last so its shared-directory file snapshot remains authoritative. A busy descendant is aborted before it is reverted, like the parent, so nothing keeps writing past the revert boundary. Redo clears the revert marker on every descendant, including markers the user set on a subagent independently of the parent undo.
11. Starting a session from an assistant answer carries the source session ID, rendered directory, and answer text into the action. It must not rediscover that context from the globally active child store or the OpenCode client's fallback directory: the visible session may belong to an existing worktree while the active provider directory points elsewhere. New isolated worktrees resolve their registered parent project from that captured directory, preferring recorded worktree metadata when available. The dialog offers creation only after the project root is confirmed as a Git repository, and the creation boundary repeats that check so stale or bypassed UI state cannot run Git commands against a non-repository directory; failures leave the dialog open and visible.
12. Slash commands use `session.command` so OpenCode expands their templates. Slash skills use the optimistic prompt path with native skill attachments, preserving the original text and any inline skill mentions. A cached command takes precedence over a same-name skill in the session's directory. Both routes carry files and admit attached context, including session knowledge, as synthetic messages before sending.

Examples of global-store updates performed in `session-actions.ts`:

- `createSession()` -> `upsertSession(session)`
- `updateSessionTitle()` -> `upsertSession(result.data)`
- `shareSession()` / `unshareSession()` -> `upsertSession(result.data)`
- `archiveSession()` / `archiveSessions()` -> wait for server confirmation, then upsert each archived session
- `unarchiveSession()` / `unarchiveSessions()` -> wait for server confirmation, then upsert each restored session
- `deleteSession()` / `deleteSessions()` -> wait for server confirmation or `404`, then remove the session and its persisted state
- `moveSessionToDirectory()` -> move the session between directory stores and update the global directory index

### Blocking-request (form/permission) reply routing

`replyToForm`, `cancelForm`, `respondToPermission`, and `dismissPermission` route the reply through `resolveDirectoryForBlockingRequest`. The directory chosen decides which OpenCode instance resolves the pending request, so it must be the **session record's own server-confirmed directory** (ownership), never the containing child-store key (containment): a project store legitimately holds its worktree sessions, and a reply addressed to the parent instance makes the server answer `FormNotFoundError` while the form stays pending in the worktree instance — the session is then stuck on the running form tool with no recovery. When a reply/reject comes back not-found, the stale request is removed locally and a `settled-running-tool` tail materialization is enqueued so the trailing tool part converges to the server's actual state instead of leaving the UI on "asking question" forever.

### Restore (unarchive) contract

The OpenCode server cannot clear `time.archived` over HTTP: `session.update`
only applies the field when the payload carries a finite number, so an omitted
key is a no-op and `null` is silently ignored. Restore therefore writes
`time.archived = 0` (`UNARCHIVED_TIMESTAMP` in `session-actions.ts`). Every
client-side reader classifies archive state by truthiness of `time.archived`,
so `0` reads as active in the UI, the event reducer, and the OpenCode app/TUI.

The server's `time_archived IS NULL` list filter still excludes such rows, so
any query that wants a truthful active list must fetch inclusively
(`archived: true`) and split client-side (`splitGlobalSessionsByArchived`).
The global sessions store does this for its full and per-directory loads;
directory bootstrap keeps using the server filter because live child stores
must not hold archived sessions. A restored session re-enters its live
directory store through the authoritative `session.updated` event the server
publishes for the update; until then it remains fully visible through the
global store (sidebar, switcher) and addressable by ID (message loading).

The full-app collection retains active records whose directory is absent from
the current topology. Display grouping first resolves exact configured
project/worktree ownership. If that fails, authoritative OpenCode project
metadata may resolve the record only when its canonical worktree maps to a
configured project root. The fallback never replaces the session's real
directory for requests. An unresolved record has no guaranteed project group.
VS Code keeps exact workspace-directory scope without this fallback. Mobile
uses the same resolver as the full-app sidebar.

Archive and delete actions capture the active runtime key when they start and
recheck it before every store reconciliation, so a response
produced by the previous runtime is rejected instead of mutating the current
runtime's live or global session state. Restore follows the same guard: a
stale completion returns `false` without touching any store. A guarded batch
stops at the first observed runtime change: sessions the server already
confirmed remain archived, restored, or deleted and stay in
`archivedIds`/`restoredIds`/`deletedIds`, while every ID not confirmed on the
captured runtime is returned in `failedIds` so existing partial-failure
feedback stays truthful.
Callers whose confirmation can span a runtime switch may pass an
`expectedRuntimeKey` captured earlier; ordinary callers are guarded by default.

`unarchiveSession` clears the archive timestamp in the session's existing directory. It never moves the session, including when that directory is missing. Server failure keeps the session archived locally; confirmation updates the global cache and reads fresh live status for an existing child store. A failed status read does not undo a confirmed restore or claim the session is idle. If the runtime switches after confirmation, the status read cannot write into the new runtime, but the confirmed restore still returns success on the captured runtime. `unarchiveSessions` preserves partial results and stops committing when its captured runtime changes.

### Deletion runtime guard

Deletion needs this guard more than archiving does. Session IDs are not unique
across runtimes, and a committed deletion does more than hide a row: it evicts
the session from every live store, removes it from the global cache, clears the
current-session pointer, and calls `cleanupPersistedSessionState`, which erases
that session's queued messages, todos, folder membership, inline-comment drafts,
chat draft, and pins. Committing a stale deletion can therefore destroy user
state belonging to an unrelated session on the new runtime.

`cleanupPersistedSessionState` already refuses an identity whose runtime is no
longer active, so `finalizeConfirmedSessionDeletion` must forward the **captured**
runtime key. Passing the live key would make that check compare a value with
itself and always pass. The in-memory live, global, and UI stores it mutates are
not runtime-scoped, so the calling action must reject a stale runtime before
committing rather than relying on that helper alone.

A `404` still means "already deleted" and commits cleanup, but only while the
captured runtime is active. After a runtime change the `404` describes either
the previous runtime or one this session never belonged to, so the action
reports failure instead of committing. The deletion already accepted by the
server stays deleted there; its persisted state is left as harmless stale
metadata and the next authoritative load reconciles it.

### Missing worktree directories

Existing sessions keep their directory when a worktree disappears. Session activation makes no directory-availability probe, and terminal failures and archive restoration never move sessions. Manual movement still goes through `moveSessionToDirectory`. Worktree deletion still archives its sessions before removing the worktree. Missing-worktree groups stay visible with a warning so users can choose either action.

After a restore succeeds while its captured runtime is still current, the
action promotes the session through the ordering-only restore entry point. That
rank is ephemeral and resets with runtime ordering. It does not alter server
timestamps, synthesize activity, or change live status. Recent keeps its
existing active/48-hour membership rule.

## The golden rule

### Managed chat directories

Ordinary user-created drafts default to the OpenChamber-managed Chat target. The first submit creates one isolated directory under the server-resolved managed chats root (`OPENCHAMBER_CHATS_DIR`, default `~/.config/openchamber/chats`) as `YYYY-MM-DD/session-<id>` before creating the OpenCode session. That root acts as a system project owner for sidebar membership and Notes, Todo, Plans, pinned knowledge, and project memory, but it is never persisted or rendered as a user project and exposes no Git/worktree controls. Project and worktree actions remain explicit targets. Archiving retains a chat directory so restore remains lossless. Confirmed deletion accepts only descendants of the configured root or the actual server home's legacy chats root. It rejects both shared roots themselves, dot segments, lookalike paths elsewhere, and a runtime switch during root resolution. It also removes a directory only once no other known session still resolves to it: forks, side threads, and subagents share the directory of the chat that created them, and OpenCode fails every prompt in a session whose directory is gone. The deleted session's own subtree does not count, because the server cascade-deletes it, and an unloaded global cache keeps the directory because it cannot prove it is unused. It never removes project directories.

The home API also supplies filesystem-confirmed `canonicalChatsRoot` and
`canonicalLegacyChatsRoot` aliases. Membership and cleanup compare each alias
exactly, protecting the shared roots themselves. Helpers still return the original
configured/legacy root as the identity for folders and scopes. Older servers
without these fields retain exact matching against their original roots; the UI
never guesses filesystem case sensitivity from the client's operating system.

Typing the first character in a managed Chat draft starts one deduplicated directory preparation for that draft. Materialization consumes the prepared directory before `createSession`, removing filesystem creation from the usual submit path. Closing the draft, changing it to a project target, or completing preparation after the runtime/draft changed deletes the unclaimed directory. A create failure also deletes the consumed directory.

The global sessions store persists and hydrates one bounded, runtime-scoped startup snapshot containing only active managed chat sessions. Every global session surface, including the main sidebar and Electron Mini Chat switcher, sees that stale snapshot while the global list is unresolved or failed; the first authoritative global snapshot replaces it. Full and directory-scoped global loads resolve the active server's chats roots before fetching or classifying sessions. The store enters loading before resolving roots and hydrates its saved snapshot once roots are available, preserving any newer mutations. Root lookup failure preserves the snapshot for a later retry; a failed global request retains the hydrated sessions. Old runtime completions cannot hydrate or fetch for the destination runtime. Persistence waits for root authority; before hydration it overlays explicit mutations onto the saved seed rather than replacing it with a partial list, and the first page of a still-paginating full load is merged into the visible lists (status stays `loading`) without ever being persisted as that snapshot. Hydration happens once per runtime, so a later global load cannot undo an earlier directory refresh. Runtime reset to idle must hydrate rather than erase the destination runtime's snapshot; authoritative empty, archive, and delete updates do persist the resulting empty or reduced list.

VS Code intentionally has no managed Chats mode. It neither reads nor writes the managed Chats startup cache, regular drafts continue to target the open workspace, and the global session store rejects managed chat sessions from both snapshots and live upserts before any VS Code surface can consume them. Sidebar and switcher filters repeat that exclusion defensively.

### Remembering the last draft target

`session-ui-store.ts` persists the side of the composer's target selector the user last worked on under `oc.chatInput.lastDraftTarget`, so a plain new session reopens there instead of always landing on Chat. The record holds a project id, a directory, and `target`, which is `"chat"`, `"project"`, or `null`.

`null` is what a record written before `target` existed reads as, and it leaves the Chat default in place rather than guessing a side from the directory. A recorded project that no longer exists falls back to Chat the same way. Only a picker choice writes `"chat"` or `"project"`.

A session's own directory is not a target choice. "New session in the current directory" forwards the current session's directory even when that session is a managed chat, and a chat scratch directory names no project, so those overrides resolve to a chat draft. Treating one as an explicit project target is how a plus pressed inside a chat opened a project draft.

A live directory that names no registered project is not a target choice either: an implicit, user-initiated open stays on the managed Chat target for that draft and leaves the recorded project target untouched. Delayed stale-directory recovery repairs only project drafts, so it cannot replace that Chat target or its remembered project target.

When creating a draft in `handleDirectoryEvent`, **only clone the state fields the event will mutate**. Never spread all fields eagerly.

```typescript
// WRONG — clones everything, breaks referential equality for all subscribers
const draft = {
  ...current,
  session: [...current.session],
  message: { ...current.message },
  part: { ...current.part },
  permission: { ...current.permission },
  // ...
}

// RIGHT — only clone what this event type touches
const draft = { ...current }
switch (event.type) {
  case "message.part.delta":
    draft.part = { ...current.part }
    break
}
```

## Why this matters

Zustand skips re-renders when a selector returns the same reference (`Object.is`). If you spread `session: [...current.session]` but the event only modifies `part`, the `session` array gets a new reference. Every component using `useSessions()` re-renders for nothing.

During streaming, `message.part.delta` fires ~60 times/sec. Eagerly cloning all fields caused every subscriber in the entire app to re-render 60/sec — a 10x overhead. Targeted cloning reduced MessageList renders from ~1972 to ~296 per session.

## Event → field mapping

Queue recovery is independent of the directory-bootstrap debounce. The sync
provider subscribes to `message-queue-sync.ts` for control-stream updates and
requests a queue refresh on every main-stream connection or transport switch,
including the first connection. The queue store coalesces these requests with
bootstrap and owns snapshot ordering and legacy-upload lifetime.

Keep this in sync with `handleDirectoryEvent` in `sync-context.tsx`:

| Event type | Fields to clone |
|---|---|
| `session.created/patched/deleted` | `session`, `permission`, `form`, `part`, `sessionEventRevision`, `sessionDeletedRevision` (an archive patch also clears caches) |
| `session.status/idle/error` | `session_status` |
| `message.updated` | `message` |
| `message.patched` | `message` |
| `message.removed` | `message`, `part` |
| `message.part.updated/delta`, `message.tool.transition`, `message.parts.replaced` | `part` |
| `vcs.branch.updated` | (none — mutates `draft.vcs` directly) |
| `permission.asked/replied` | `permission` |
| `form.created/settled` | `form` |
| `openchamber.notification`, `openchamber.permission-auto-accept`, `openchamber.permission-left-for-user` | (none — side effects only) |

These are `SyncEvent`s from `packages/ui/src/lib/opencode/events.ts`, not OpenCode wire events: the event pipeline translates every OpenCode 2.x wire event (`session.text.delta`, `session.tool.called`, `session.step.ended`, ...) into this vocabulary before coalescing. Wire-level knowledge lives only in that translator; the reducer applies patches and tool-state transitions against the store.

### Directory-less session events

The global stream can omit a directory for a session-addressed event. Resolve it through the session routing index first. If the index is briefly stale during a session transition, route only when the event session matches the active session and that directory store exists; otherwise leave it un-routed rather than updating another directory.

## Adding a new event type

1. Add the case to the event reducer (`event-reducer.ts`)
2. Add a corresponding case to the switch in `handleDirectoryEvent` (`sync-context.tsx`) that clones **only** the fields your reducer writes to
3. If your event fires frequently (more than a few times per second), verify that unrelated components don't re-render — check with the stream perf counters

## Selector hygiene

### Runtime context versus directory context

`SyncProvider` publishes two contexts. `SyncRuntimeContext` (`useSyncRuntime()`)
holds the child-store manager, message loader, SDK, runtime key, and a
subscribable `currentDirectory` source; its value changes only on runtime
reconfiguration. `SyncContext` (`useSyncSystem()` / `useSync()`) adds the
current directory string, so every consumer re-renders on each directory
switch.

A hook that takes an explicit directory, or needs only runtime fields, must
read `useSyncRuntime()`. `useDirectoryStore(directory)` reads the current
directory through `runtime.currentDirectory` with `useSyncExternalStore`, so a
consumer that passes its own directory gets a constant snapshot and is not
re-rendered by a cross-project switch. This is what keeps sidebar rows
(permissions, form counts, session lookups) out of the switch commit: a
row must not pay for the chat changing directory.

### Session switch commit

The sidebar click publishes `currentSessionId`/`currentSessionDirectory`
synchronously, and the message fetch starts before that publication so the
request is on the wire while React renders. `ChatContainer` consumes a
`useDeferredValue` copy of the selection: the first commit paints the cheap
reactions (active row, URL, tabs) and the timeline for the new session renders
in a transition behind it. Selection *policy* inside `ChatContainer` (auto-
opening a draft when nothing is selected) reads the live store value, because
the deferred one still names the previous session for one commit.

A session whose messages are not in memory at the click keeps the previous
timeline on screen while they load (up to 400ms), then swaps straight to the
finished view; the skeleton appears only when loading takes longer. A session
the user waited for fades in (100ms); one that was ready appears in the same
frame. The sidebar prefetches the row on either side of the open session shortly
after it settles, so most neighbouring switches are warm.

The column changes as one. The composer and the status chip above it read
the session the timeline shows (`components/chat/chatColumnSession.ts`), not
the live selection: read live, they re-shaped a commit ahead of the swap
(a taller draft, chips, a working chip) and the outgoing timeline, pinned to
its end, jumped before it was replaced. The reveal effect below runs once per
gate for the same reason — `revealWaited` flips for the outgoing session at
the click, and re-running on it hid that timeline before the next one mounted.

The timeline's first paint for a session is atomic. `ChatContainer` owns a
`TimelineRevealGate` per session key (`components/chat/timelineRevealGate.ts`):
a markdown renderer whose first paint is provisional (blocks not yet in the
settled cache, so code is unhighlighted) takes a hold in its layout effect,
and the timeline root stays at opacity 0 until every hold releases, capped at
250ms, then fades in once as a whole. A warm switch takes no holds and reveals
in the same frame. The gate stops accepting holds after the opening commit so
rows mounting during scroll never hide the timeline. Once the lazy markdown
module has loaded, `MarkdownRenderer` mounts it synchronously instead of
through `Suspense`: a suspended boundary shows its fallback for a tick and
React then throttles later-resolving boundaries by ~300ms, which staggered
user and assistant text on a cold open.

An opened session is shown already in place: at its end, or where the reader
left it. When a list detaches (session switch, chat unmount) and its reader is
away from the live end, `useChatTimelineScroll` records the topmost visible
message and its offset (`lib/scroll/messageViewportAnchor.ts`) in an in-memory,
100-session memory keyed by runtime, directory and session
(`lib/scroll/sessionScrollMemory.ts`); a reader on the end clears the record.
Nothing is persisted across reloads. Re-entering the session aligns that
message frame by frame until it holds still, with follow off and the
scroll-to-bottom pill shown; any wheel, touch, pointer or key input ends the
alignment. Turn group expansion is cached by turn ID in `MessageList` so the
restored rows have the shape they were left with. When the message lies before
the loaded window (the history was evicted meanwhile),
`useChatTimelineController.loadHistoryUntilMessage` loads at most three older
batches while the timeline stays hidden; that hold raises the gate's cap to
800ms, so a fast load shows the session already in place. A slower one reveals
the end first, and the reader is moved only if the message arrives and they
have neither scrolled nor sent in the meantime. Mobile skips that search because it
loads history only on an explicit tap.

A message link opens the session on one message instead. Links are built and
parsed in `lib/sessionLinks.ts`: the web copies `?session=<id>&message=<id>` on
its own origin, desktop and the Capacitor app copy
`openchamber://session/<id>?message=<id>`, and VS Code offers no link because
its sessions live on its own OpenCode. Every entry point (the web route, the
desktop `openchamber:open-session` event, mobile deep links, a session link
clicked in chat content) calls `openSessionLink`, which records the message in
`lib/router/messageFocus.ts` and opens the session through the route opener so
a cross-project session resolves its directory. The timeline serves the
request on entry, ahead of a remembered position, or immediately when that
session is already open. Being shown does not end the request: a link can
select its session twice, first under a guessed directory and then under the
one the session list reports, and the second timeline must show the message
again whether the first was torn down mid-search or had already shown it. The
request ends when the message proves missing, when the reader takes the
viewport (any real gesture), when another session is entered, or after a
minute. A repeated click on the same link is a new request and is shown
again. Controls that raise a request can show progress through a separate
status channel (`subscribeMessageFocusStatus`, `readMessageFocusInFlight`):
the timeline marks a request shown when it lands, which is progress and does
not serve the request again. The message lands just below the scroller's top fade
(`--scroll-shadow-size` plus a small gap), not inside it where it reads as
cut off, and is tinted briefly (`[data-message-link-target]`). A target
folded into a collapsed turn (an assistant step before the turn's last one,
whose text lives in the folded activity) opens that turn first
(`MessageList` `revealFoldedMessage`), the way a browser's find opens a closed
`<details>`; the final answer is visible folded and opens nothing. Message
search uses this path: a hit in Cmd+P (`components/ui/commandPaletteMessages`)
opens its message through `openSessionLink`, and the in-conversation bar
(`components/chat/search`) moves between hits with `requestMessageFocus`,
painting matches with the CSS Custom Highlight API. The index itself is the
server's (`packages/web/server/lib/message-search`). A linked message outside the
loaded window is first checked with one `session.message.get` request: a 404
shows a "not in this session" toast, anything else loads older history until
the message or the start of the history, on every runtime including mobile.
Chat markdown keeps `openchamber://` hrefs only for session links and turns
pasted ones into links; pairing and other routes stay stripped. A web session
link opens in place when it points at the page's origin or at the instance
the app is connected to (the desktop page has its own scheme, so a link to
its connected remote host would otherwise leave through the host-window
path). On desktop a link to a saved instance opens in that instance's app
window: an open window for the instance takes it (brought to the front and
moved to the session through `openchamber:open-session`), otherwise
`openHostWindow` creates one on the session route; "New window" from the
instance switcher always opens a fresh one. A link to any other address
keeps the external path. A session
deep link that launches the desktop app arrives before the renderer listens:
`main.mjs` keeps it pending and the main window takes it on mount through
`desktop_take_pending_session_links` (`takePendingDesktopSessionLinks`); a
late flush still emits it to a renderer that never asks.

On launch the app reopens the session that was open when it closed
(`sync/last-session-restore.ts`, used by `App` for web and desktop and by the
Capacitor shell). `setCurrentSession` persists the pointer per runtime and a
user-opened draft clears it, so the pointer names exactly what was on screen;
without one the launch stays on the automatic draft. A route, link, or click
that selected a session first wins. The sidebar's project session selection
(`useProjectSessionSelection`) ignores the project active when the list
mounts and reacts only to later project switches; it used to pick that
project's remembered or first session on launch.

The scroll hook holds the gate
until the viewport is in place; the recap note holds it until the session record
is in memory, because it cannot decide whether it renders before that and would
otherwise grow the footer under a pinned viewport. The reveal itself runs on
the next frame after the last hold releases, with one exact pin against the
final content height. Afterwards "at the end" is an invariant, not a scroll:
while the reader sits on the end of a session that is not producing output,
content growth re-pins with one instant write; output growth belongs to the
follow logic, which glides only while the session is working.

`useChatTimelineScroll` retires an outgoing scroll container through
`components/chat/lib/scroll/retireScrollContent.ts`. Chromium can retain a
queued scroll event's target while animation frames are suspended, keeping its
detached conversation tree alive. After React's commit and Markdown DOM-cache
capture, a microtask clears the retired container's remaining children. The
cleanup requires both a disconnected node and released ownership, so ref
reattachment, Strict Mode and connected hidden views keep their contents.
Nodes already transferred to the Markdown cache remain intact. This shared
cleanup runs independently of animation frames across all chat runtimes.

`bun run profile:switch` measures both moments; see `scripts/perf/DOCUMENTATION.md`.

Select leaf values, not containers:

```typescript
// WRONG — returns entire Map/object, new reference on any mutation
useDirectorySync((s) => s.permission)

// RIGHT — returns the value for one key, stable unless that key changes
useDirectorySync((s) => s.permission[sessionID] ?? EMPTY)
```

Same applies to `useStreamingStore` — select `.get(key)` not the Map itself.

## Store splitting pattern

### Why split

A single Zustand store with N properties means every subscriber's selector re-evaluates on every state change — even if the change is unrelated to what that subscriber reads. During streaming, `sessionMemoryState` updates ~60/sec. Before the split, all 68+ `useSessionUIStore` subscribers re-evaluated on each update. After splitting into focused stores, only `useViewportStore` subscribers (2-3 components) re-evaluate.

The optimization multiplies with targeted event cloning: fewer new references per event × fewer subscribers per store = dramatically less work per SSE frame.

### The stores

| Store | Owns | When it changes |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| `session-ui-store.ts` | Session selection, draft lifecycle, abort, worktree, SDK actions | Session switch, draft open/close |
| `voice-store.ts` | Voice connection/activity state | Voice toggle |
| `input-store.ts` | Pending input text, synthetic parts, attached files, pending guest attach | User typing, file attach, revert/fork, guest chip |
| `selection-store.ts` | Per-session model/agent/variant choices | Model/agent picker |
| `viewport-store.ts` | Scroll anchors, session memory state, sync status | Streaming, scroll, session switch |

### Rules for new UI state

1. **Never add to `session-ui-store`** unless it's session selection, draft lifecycle, or abort state
2. **Group by change frequency** — state that changes during streaming (viewport, memory) must not live with state that changes on user action (selections, input)
3. **Skip canonical no-ops** — selecting a session must not republish an already-reset draft; session ID and directory remain the authoritative navigation publication.
4. **Group by subscriber set** — if only 2 components read a value, it should be in a store that only those 2 components subscribe to
5. **Prefer a new store over growing an existing one** if the new state has different subscribers or change frequency
6. **Cross-store reads use `.getState()`** — actions in one store that need to read another store call `useOtherStore.getState()` (imperative, no subscription)

### Anti-patterns

```typescript
// WRONG — stuffing unrelated state into one store
const useEverythingStore = create(() => ({
  voiceMode: "idle",
  scrollAnchor: 0,
  selectedModel: null,
  pendingInput: "",
  // 20 more fields...
}))

// RIGHT — separate stores by concern + change frequency
const useVoiceStore = create(() => ({ voiceMode: "idle" }))
const useViewportStore = create(() => ({ scrollAnchor: 0 }))
const useSelectionStore = create(() => ({ selectedModel: null }))
const useInputStore = create(() => ({ pendingInput: "" }))
```
