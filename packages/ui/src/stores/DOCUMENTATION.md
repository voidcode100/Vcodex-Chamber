# UI Stores

## Purpose

`packages/ui/src/stores` contains app-level Zustand stores for persistent UI state, runtime state, and feature caches.

Not all state in the UI belongs here.

Use a store when state is:

- shared across distant parts of the app
- needed outside a single component subtree
- cache-like and keyed by runtime identity (for example directory, branch, session id)
- updated imperatively from multiple surfaces

Do not put high-frequency local component state here just because it is convenient.

## Architecture

There are multiple store categories in this directory.

### Catalog refresh

`catalogRefresh.ts` re-reads the lists Settings and the composer show — agents,
commands, skills, MCP servers, plugins, providers — when OpenCode reports that
it rebuilt a catalog. The sync layer calls it from `reloadCatalog`; see
`packages/ui/src/sync/DOCUMENTATION.md` for the kind-to-list table. There is no
pending-restart queue: config mutations take effect as soon as OpenCode has
re-read the file, and only the OpenCode binary path restarts the server.

The agents store counts load generations: `invalidateAgentsLoadCache` starts a
new one, and a load never joins a read that began in an older generation. It
waits for that read and reads again, so a refresh after a delete cannot be
answered by the read the delete itself started.

Plugin catalogs carry `loadedDirectory` and `loadedRuntimeKey`, the owner of
the installed list. The editor waits for that directory's catalog before hydrating a draft;
plugin IDs alone are not unique across projects. Catalog requests and their
TTL caches are scoped by runtime and directory. A response for a superseded
owner cannot replace the catalog or finish the current owner's loading state.

### Feature cache / query stores

The Stats page keeps its reports in a feature-local store, `components/views/usage/usageStatsStore.ts`: keyed by runtime, range and project, in memory only, never refetched on its own once a key has a report, cleared on runtime switch. A failed refresh keeps the cached report. The report is requested with `tools: "none"`; tool calls, which make OpenCode scan every tool call in the range, load on request under the same key, over the loaded report's own window. Once the user asks for them, every report shown later in the app session fetches its tool calls after it lands. A failed tool read shows an error with retry and never reads as zero calls.

PR status reads share the aggregate background-network budget as well as their PR-specific cap. Command discovery gates each scope/config read, including body decoding, rather than only gating the initial SDK list. Command reads have a bounded deadline and abort on runtime reset. Reset clears server-derived command caches and invalidates late reads and mutation responses while preserving unsaved command drafts.

These are the most performance-sensitive.

- `useGitStore.ts`
- `useGitHubPrStatusStore.ts`
- `useFilesViewTabsStore.ts`

These stores act like centralized keyed caches. UI should consume narrow slices from them instead of re-fetching the same data in multiple places.

`useQuotaStore` keeps the last authoritative provider results separately from
`refreshErrors`. Transport failures and configured-provider errors preserve the
last usage sample and its timestamp. An explicit unconfigured response replaces
old configuration; a first-load transport failure leaves it unknown. Concurrent
refreshes share one request per provider. Runtime reset aborts those requests,
and generation checks prevent their completions from changing the next runtime.
`lib/quota/fetchQuota.ts` validates response payloads and bounds the complete
request, including JSON body delivery. Compact usage cards and Settings display
refresh errors alongside retained data. The mobile popover makes at most one
refresh attempt per opening, so a failed first load cannot create a retry loop.

`useSmallModelStore` answers one question: can OpenChamber's background model
(the Small Model) run right now? `GET /api/small-model` says `available: false`
on, for instance, a fresh install on OpenCode's free tier, where chat works but
a stateless generation has nothing to run on. Session renaming, the session goal
and the walkthrough depend on it, so their entry points read the store through
`hooks/useSmallModelAvailability` and show a disabled control with the reason
instead of failing after the click. Cached per runtime + directory for a
minute, refetched only while the control that asks is open; a config change
(provider login, settings save) or a runtime switch drops every answer. A failed
or malformed fetch keeps the previous answer: an unreachable server is not
evidence that the model went away. Callers with a graceful fallback (a note kept
verbatim, a reply spoken in full) do not consult it; they silence the 404 on
`requestSmallModel` instead.

### UI state stores

Sidebar visibility and its persisted width are independent. Opening or closing
the sidebar never writes a width; only resizing changes the saved choice.
The initial width is separate from the component's minimum resize width.

`useCommitSelectionStore.ts` shares the selected commit between desktop/mobile
Changes and walkthrough. Choices are session-only and keyed by runtime, directory, and
checked-out branch, with at most 100 remembered choices. The picker history
belongs to `useCommitComparison`, loads only while Commit mode is active, and
is limited to the latest 50 commits. History failure stays distinct from an
empty list; stale directory/runtime requests cannot replace current history or
selection. A refreshed list preserves an explicit selection even when newer
commits have pushed it beyond the latest 50.

`hooks/useGitComparison.ts` owns the local file-list state used by desktop and
mobile comparisons. Its key contains runtime, directory, and the complete
branch/commit/PR source. A source change hides the old list immediately; failed
reads remain errors, and manual retries cannot publish into a superseded scope.
The hook also resolves per-file patch requests, including a commit rename's
previous path. Views own their lazy patch caches through `useRangeKeyedCache`.
Mobile requests only the active detail path and suspends reads while its
keep-alive workspace pane is hidden.

`usePullRequestSelectionStore.ts` shares session-only PR choices across desktop,
mobile Changes and walkthrough, keyed by runtime, directory and checked-out
branch. Explicit selection bounds remembered choices to 100 entries. A choice
contains the PR number and its repository, so fork and upstream PRs with equal
numbers remain distinct. `usePullRequestComparison` owns the searchable,
paginated list while PR mode is active. The shared GitHub PR status store's
fork/remote-aware resolver supplies the initial choice, independently of list
pagination. An absent match requires selection. External walkthrough handoffs
apply once, and later picker changes
remain authoritative when a retained panel becomes visible again.

Examples:

- `useUIStore.ts`
- `useDirectoryStore.ts`
- `useFeatureFlagsStore.ts`
- `useUpdateStore.ts`

These stores coordinate visible app state, navigation, selected context-panel tabs, dialogs, and lightweight feature flags. `useUIStore.activeSurface` selects the primary mobile view and the few desktop views that are promoted out of the context panel. It is not a desktop tab selection. Linear panel list filters (status, assignee, team, priority) live here too: the Linear rail surface remounts on switch, so those filters restore from this store rather than component state. `resetLinearIssueListFilters` restores those four defaults together; search stays local to the rail. The team filter is the one that is not a plain preference: a Linear team belongs to one workspace, and each OpenChamber instance has its own Linear login, so it is persisted per instance in `linearIssueListTeamIdByRuntime` and the flat `linearIssueListTeamId` is derived from it by `applyLinearIssueListFiltersForRuntime` — on an instance switch and when the rail mounts, since rehydration can run before the runtime endpoint is known. Carried across, a team id filters the new instance's list down to nothing. `linearIssueFocus` is a one-shot identifier so work-status can open a specific issue in that panel; it is not persisted. Opening a new browser tab with an address (`openContextPreview`, `openContextBrowser`, `openAgentBrowserTab`) notes it, keyed by directory and tab id, in the session-only set in `lib/browser/devServerWait.ts`; the tab's first mount reads and forgets it. Only a noted tab waits for its dev server on the first load. A tab restored from saved state, or remounted later, loads once and shows the failure. When those openers hit a tab that already exists, they send it a session-only load request instead. A mounted tab that shows a failure, or has not shown a page yet, loads the address the way a typed one loads, wait included, so a failure from launch does not stay up once a project action starts the server; a tab showing a working page ignores the request and is only focused, keeping what the person had on it.

Context-panel session chats mount only the active chat iframe. After installing
its message listener, the iframe requests its authoritative visibility from the
parent. The parent accepts requests only from a currently mounted chat frame and
answers from the current active tab. Do not rely only on a parent `onLoad`
notification: it can arrive before the iframe listener exists and leave a
visible chat with background work disabled. Message-history subscriptions in the
mounted session-chat iframe stay enabled independently of that visibility flag
so a delayed or lost handshake cannot hide an already-materialized transcript
(busy subagents would otherwise show only the working-status row).

### Session / project coordination stores

`useMultiRunStore` creates ID-bound multi-run members. Runs are projected from
the session lists (`lib/multirun/runs.ts`), not kept in a store of their own.
Membership, fork handling, fusion and legacy compatibility are owned by
`lib/multirun/DOCUMENTATION.md`.

`useProjectsStore.hasServerSnapshot` distinguishes a server-confirmed project list from persisted startup hints; `serverSnapshotFailed` records a failed settings sync without clearing the last confirmed list. Successful settings adoption clears that failure even for an unchanged list. Runtime switching clears both flags. Extension project subscriptions consume these flags and project records without changing active selection.

Project parsing, project selection, directory navigation, mobile session paths, and the SDK adapter share `lib/pathNormalization.ts` for request paths. Tilde expansion happens before normalization. Windows drive roots retain their slash, and parent navigation stops at drive and UNC share roots. Selecting a spelling variant of the current directory preserves history and its forward entries. Bare drive-relative paths such as `C:` stay distinct from `C:/`; normalization does not guess their filesystem target.

Examples:

- `useProjectsStore.ts`
- `useGlobalSessionsStore.ts`
- `useSessionFoldersStore.ts`
- `useProjectContextStore.ts`
- `messageQueueStore.ts`
- `useRoutingStore.ts`

These stores coordinate persistent project/session metadata across multiple views.

`useProjectContextStore.ts` caches server-owned project notes, todos, and plan links, keyed by the path-derived project id. It replaced a pair of `window` CustomEvents that made every mounted notes panel re-read the whole project config. Writes are optimistic and roll back on failure; they are serialized per project, because the server's own store does a read-modify-write and two concurrent saves would otherwise race it. A load that resolves while a write is in flight keeps the local value for that field group only, so a slow snapshot cannot undo newer typing while still delivering the plan list it fetched. A failed load sets `error` and preserves the cached snapshot — an unreachable server must never render as "this project has no notes". Note and plan creation are deliberately not optimistic, since ids and timestamps are assigned by the server. Notes, todos, and plans are written through separate routes and tracked by separate in-flight flags, so a todo toggle cannot clobber a note edit in the same window. Pinned notes and plans are assembled into a synthetic context part by `lib/projectContextPinning.ts` at send time; that module tracks per-session what it already sent so an unchanged pinned set is not re-sent every turn.

`useRoutingStore.ts` projects the server's Jev routing state (whether the Auto
model may be offered, the config Settings → Routing edits, the last decision
per session, permissions the safety net is holding). Nothing is persisted; a
failed read keeps what was known and records `loadError` instead of reading as
"routing is off". See `packages/web/server/lib/routing/DOCUMENTATION.md`.

`messageQueueStore.ts` has two owners, decided by `isServerOwnedMessageQueue()`.
On web, desktop, and mobile the server delivers the queue independently of the
UI. The store projects authoritative snapshots and revisioned session updates.
`sync/message-queue-sync.ts` receives queue events through the shared control SSE
stream at `/api/openchamber/events`, including while OpenCode uses SSE fallback.
It adds no poller or per-session connection. Either stream reconnecting requests
`resync()`, independently of directory-bootstrap suppression.

Hydration and recovery share one in-flight request per runtime. A recovery edge
during its snapshot read earns one trailing read; legacy uploads are attempted
once per runtime rather than repeated on reconnect or snapshot failure. Snapshot
reads have a 15-second deadline. Failure preserves the projection and runtime
switches reject stale completions. Full-snapshot revisions also cover omitted
sessions, so a delayed mutation response cannot resurrect a cleared queue;
session events newer than that snapshot survive reconciliation.

Mutations are optimistic and then settled on the server's copy; failed
round-trips re-read instead of guessing. Empty legacy events without a directory
clear all projections of their session in that runtime. Projection items carry
attachment metadata only, so `popToInput()` and `takeForSend()` asynchronously
remove the message on the server and retrieve its complete captured payload.

`lib/messages/queuedMessagePreview.ts` derives the queue row from typed text,
then attached comments/context, then the first filename. The store sends a
bounded `contextPreview` with the captured item so server projections can show
context-only messages without carrying full quotes or diffs. VS Code derives
the same preview from its local full item. Preview text is display-only;
editing and delivery always use the original content and captured context.

A queued message is captured whole, so whoever delivers it sends exactly what the composer would have: `text` (the content with its agent mention stripped and `@file` mentions already resolved into `attachments`), `agentMention`, and `context` — every chip the composer had attached (inline comments, terminal selections, browser annotations, PR comments/checks, quotes, linked issue/PR/Linear references, pending synthetic parts) plus the skill instruction derived from the text. `QueuedContextPart` distinguishes attached items (restored to the chips when the message is edited) from derived instructions (re-derived on send, never restored) and from synthetic parts other surfaces handed the composer (restored as pending). Context is captured by `buildComposerContext` and delivered by `queuedContextToParts` (`components/chat/composer/submit/buildOutgoingMessage.ts`), the same functions the composer uses for its own send. Nothing is re-resolved at delivery: the server has no agent list, no confirmed mentions, and no draft store. Messages a previous build left in this browser are uploaded once on the first hydration of a runtime and then dropped from persistence for that runtime (`partialize` skips server-owned runtime keys). VS Code has no server and keeps the local queue with the foreground auto-send hook (`useQueuedMessageAutoSend`, enabled only there); `useMessageQueueHoldSync` tells the server to hold a session's queue while a UI-driven auto-review run is going.

In the local (VS Code) mode the store keeps a queued message until its own send resolves, so between dispatch and resolution the entry is still visible to every reader. Dispatchers must therefore mark the send (`markSending`/`clearSending`) and read `getSendableQueue()` — or filter `sendingIds` themselves — instead of dispatching straight from `queuedMessages`; otherwise a composer submit merges a message the auto-send hook is already delivering and it is sent twice (the window is seconds over a relay). `clearQueue()` retains in-flight entries for the same reason. `sendingIds` is deliberately not persisted: a restart has no in-flight sends, and a stale flag would strand a queued message; in the server-owned mode it mirrors the server's in-flight item. Desktop queues use the configured host id as runtime identity, not the current API URL, because an SSH reconnect allocates a new local forwarding port while the remote host remains the same.

`useGlobalSessionsStore.ts` owns cold/global active and archived session coverage. Its entity map and active root, parent/child, and directory indexes are maintained in the same transaction as the compatibility arrays and `sessionsByDirectory`. Full authoritative snapshots may rebuild those indexes once; direct create, update, move, archive, and delete mutations update only affected hierarchy and directory buckets. Metadata-only updates preserve the structure reference. It is complementary to directory child stores: it is not the source of live busy/retry status or session messages.

User-visible session ordering is also not owned by the global cache array order. `sync/session-ordering.ts` combines lifecycle rank with timestamp fallbacks, and session surfaces must use that shared comparator instead of independently sorting global sessions by `time.updated`.

Global refresh rules:

- `hasLoaded` means a complete global snapshot has succeeded in the current runtime. Root lookup failure, partial pages, fallback data, and directory-only refreshes cannot establish it. Once established, it survives background loading and failure until runtime reset, so known empty groups do not flash loading on each poll. `status` still describes the current request and gates authoritative cleanup. Loading includes chats-root lookup, so that wait is visible too.
- The OpenCode `archived` list flag means "also include archived sessions": the server only drops its `time_archived IS NULL` condition. The global cache therefore loads with one inclusive request (`archived: true`) and splits active/archived client-side via `splitGlobalSessionsByArchived` — an `archived: false` request cannot be truthful because the server filter excludes restored sessions (`time.archived` falsy-but-present, see "Restore (unarchive) contract" in `sync/DOCUMENTATION.md`). For callers that still want only archived records, `listGlobalSessionPages` narrows inclusive responses at the data boundary (default `narrowToArchived`), so the archived cache never holds active sessions and no consumer has to re-derive that. Pagination progress stays measured on the raw response, so a page that is full upstream but filtered out here is not mistaken for the last page.
- The full load paints as it paginates: the first accepted page is merged into the visible lists immediately while the remaining pages keep loading, so a workspace with thousands of sessions is not blank until the last page arrives. That merge is an upsert (never a replacement), leaves `status` at `loading` and `hasLoaded` false, overlays mutations newer than the load baseline, and is excluded from the managed-chats snapshot write — only the complete snapshot is authoritative, persists, and raises ordering baselines.
- Per-directory refresh issues one inclusive request per directory (previously two), bounded to two requests across callers and prioritizing the current directory.
- Each directory is an independent completeness scope. A failed directory preserves its previous sessions while successful directories reconcile normally.
- Fetch failure must remain distinguishable from a successful empty list; failed scopes cannot destructively clear cached sessions.
- Runtime switch increments the load generation and clears the previous runtime's snapshot so stale in-flight work cannot commit.
- Live session mutations update the cache directly after successful SDK actions; they preserve stable directory metadata when lighter event payloads omit it.
- Full and per-directory loads capture a mutation revision. At commit time they overlay only per-session create/update/archive/delete/move mutations newer than that baseline, including no-op deletion tombstones, so an older response cannot undo newer local authority.

Permission auto-accept policy is authoritative in the active Web server or VS Code extension host. Owner snapshots carry a monotonic revision; the UI rejects lower revisions and any hydration or mutation completion captured before a runtime reset. Persisted UI policy is not live authority. The version-2 store retains an old unscoped policy only as a one-runtime legacy migration candidate, then removes it after successful migration.

Shared safe storage treats durable failures per key. A quota or access failure creates an ephemeral override or tombstone for that key without disabling reads and writes for unrelated keys; later writes retry the durable backend. Deferred adapters retain failed operations for a later flush, and malformed Zustand JSON is removed and treated as missing so hydration can recover.

Settings fields are declared once in the settings registry (`packages/ui/src/lib/settings/DOCUMENTATION.md`); the sync described here iterates that registry rather than naming keys. Project and UI settings use successful settings synchronization as authority for the fields the snapshot supplies. A field the server omits is "unset", not "reset": the window keeps whatever value it already holds and nothing is written back — a bootstrap never seeds the server from local state. The one exception is the project list, whose omission still means an empty list (`useProjectsStore`). Theme fields follow the same keep-what-you-hold rule and additionally adopt only on bootstrap-grade syncs; settings save echoes never adopt a theme. A write reaches the server only because a person changed something in this window: the theme context writes only from its user-facing setters (never on mount or on adoption), and the store-subscribing auto-savers (`appearanceAutoSave`, `modelPrefsAutoSave`) treat changes made while `isApplyingServerSettings()` is true as a new baseline rather than a change to send. `updateDesktopSettings` additionally drops any key whose value equals the last value the server was seen holding for this runtime, so an echo or a toggle back to the server's value inside the debounce window produces no request. Device-scoped registry fields (window controls, mobile keyboard mode, input bar offset) never leave the install: they are dropped from writes, persisted only locally, and adopted from a pre-split server document once per runtime as a seed. Per-surface profile fields arrive already resolved for this client's surface kind (`lib/settings/surface.ts`); the stores never see another kind's value. VS Code settings broadcasts may still adopt shared workspace pointers without replacing each webview's editor-derived theme. Transport or settings-load failure dispatches no synchronization event and preserves current state. Settings save responses are partial patches and must not clear unrelated in-memory preferences or local mirrors. Debounced settings writes flush best-effort on page hide, document hidden, app freeze, and unload — canceling the pending timer so the write happens exactly once — because a write lost inside the debounce window lets the stale server snapshot override the change on next startup; a hard process kill can still lose the in-flight request. The unload flush uses `keepalive: true` on the HTTP write, because a plain fetch started from `pagehide`/`beforeunload` is cancelled with the document; `navigator.sendBeacon` is not used, as it cannot carry the runtime bearer header. On Capacitor neither `pagehide` nor `beforeunload` fires when the OS suspends the app, so the flush also runs on `App.appStateChange` going inactive.

Session defaults belong to the active runtime. Switching instances clears the in-memory defaults and directory config snapshots; persisted config hydrates only when its recorded runtime matches. Legacy snapshots without an owner are refetched. Initialization, health checks, and directory activation reject obsolete continuations, including A to B to A switches.

Configured project and global model identifiers remain selected through provider discovery gaps. A draft can display its configured identifier before model metadata arrives. Catalog absence never selects Big Pickle in its place. An unknown settings document defers fallback selection; a successful document with no configured model permits the normal OpenCode fallback. Saved thinking preferences stay in settings; an OpenCode config `model` carries its effort as a `#variant` suffix, and a discovered model's supported variants determine the effective thinking level.

Project defaults include `defaultAgent`, `defaultModel`, and `defaultVariant`.
The project agent precedes the global agent, then OpenCode's default and the
primary-agent fallback. Settings parsers retain all three fields on every read
and save echo. The project editor loads agents, models, and effort options for
the edited project without changing the active chat's configuration.
Manual model and effort selections survive catalog gaps too. A missing catalog
entry is not a request to replace a user's choice. Directory snapshots retain
the effort override separately from its inherited value, including explicit
`Default`. Fresh drafts inherit their project's effort before the global one.

The agent and the model carry separate provenance. `setAgent` records the agent
as picked (`agentSelectionSource: 'manual'`) and leaves `selectionSource` to
describe the model alone, so an agent's pinned model stays inherited and is
never saved as a per-agent session override. Every path that re-resolves
defaults (`loadAgents`, the config-defaults reconcile, `loadSessionDefaults`,
the draft re-apply after activation, the Defaults settings page) keeps a picked
agent together with the model `setAgent` resolved for it. Only
`applyDefaultModelAgentSelection` and activating a directory with no snapshot
clear the pick. An effort picked in a draft is a choice of its own: those same
paths leave the draft alone while `currentVariantSelection.override` is set.

Project-default editing is available in desktop web and Electron. Hosted mobile
and Capacitor consume those defaults through the shared composer but have no
project-default editor. VS Code retains its workspace-project behavior and does
not adopt or edit these project settings.

`loadSessionDefaults` publishes preferences independently of OpenCode health and catalog requests. Cold directory activation starts providers and agents concurrently. Agent selection uses the latest committed preferences without waiting for providers or issuing a second settings read. Explicit preference edits update a draft immediately, and late settings responses preserve newer edits. Agent-pinned and OpenCode-config model identifiers can be selected before their catalog entries arrive.

Provider and agent catalogs carry separate successful-load flags in directory snapshots, including successful empty responses. Pickers become interactive when their own catalog is available. A known selected identifier can be displayed earlier. The composer keeps a loading label until it knows the choice or has the inputs to establish an empty selection; providers arriving alone cannot reveal an empty agent picker.

Provider reads share one request per directory, both in `loadProviders` and in the client's `getProvidersForConfig`. A read prompted by a change (a catalog event, a provider mutation) passes `fresh`: it never joins a request already in flight, because that one can carry the catalog from before the change, say a worktree opened before OpenCode registered its plugin providers. It waits that request out and reads again. When every attempt for the active directory fails and it has never loaded, one delayed retry follows; without it nothing re-reads that directory until something unrelated, such as Settings → Providers, asks.

OpenCode 2 does not wait for a directory to start before answering: the first provider read of a cold directory returns an empty or partial list, and the plugin providers arrive later with `provider.updated` for that directory. The catalog refresh re-reads only the active directory, so every catalog event also calls `markConfigCatalogStale(kind, directory)`, which takes that directory's providers or agents out of the 30-second freshness window (`null`, for a server-wide event such as a credential change, takes out all of them). Switching back to a worktree left mid-start therefore re-reads it instead of keeping the incomplete snapshot. Meanwhile the composer labels the selected model, its efforts and the agent with `selectKnownCatalogModel` / `selectKnownAgent`, which fall back to any other directory's snapshot, so a cold directory shows the name it already knows rather than a raw id or "Select agent". That fallback is display only: selection, effort resolution and validation read the active catalog, and a model or agent no catalog knows is shown as before.

An effort picked in a project draft travels to another worktree of the same project (`activateDirectory` with `preserveManualModel`), also while the model is still the automatic one. `currentVariant` is what a send carries, so every loader that keeps a pick in `currentVariantSelection` also writes that pick to `currentVariant` (`variantAfterResolve`) instead of the default it resolved for the model; otherwise the picker showed the pick and the send used the default. Marks carry a revision, and a load that began before the latest mark for its directory does not make that directory fresh again.

Settings reads retain overlapping local mutations until the read settles, including writes that finish before the older GET returns and toggles that cancel a pending write. Both the returned document and GET cache use that reconciled result. An older GET cannot replace newer server-value knowledge used to deduplicate writes.

Project ordering defaults to manual. Session display persistence v3 migrates the previously shipped `recent` project order to `manual` while preserving every other explicit sort mode.

Session display persistence keeps a hydrated local cache for the independent all-projects/single-project mode, session grouping, project sort, and Recent preference; successful server settings snapshots are authoritative for the fields they carry, and a field the server omits leaves the local cache untouched (it is not seeded back to the server). The last confirmed or manually selected project and sticky-header preference stay local to the device. Draft target changes do not write the picker selection; materialized session navigation updates it from the resolved project directory.

Session folders persist in runtime-specific v2 browser keys without silently evicting older runtime namespaces. Runtime switch, page hide, app freeze, and unload synchronously flush the pending browser snapshot before lifecycle suspension or namespace replacement. A runtime switch then cancels stale old-runtime disk work and starts generation-owned disk hydration. Missing or malformed server files are not authoritative empty snapshots; disk data may replace browser state only when it carries a real revision and no newer local folder mutation occurred. Server writes are serialized and merged per scope instead of replacing the file: a device that never saw a scope or folder cannot erase it, the incoming copy wins per folder id, and the writer's collapse state wins for the folders it sends. Because absence is not deletion, a deleted folder travels as a tombstone (`deletedFolderIds`, folder id to deletion time). The client keeps unacknowledged tombstones in runtime-scoped storage until a write succeeds, the server keeps them for 30 days and drops a tombstoned id even when a stale device sends it again, and hydration removes tombstoned folders from the browser copy whichever side is newer. VS Code keeps no disk snapshot and records no tombstones. File-search cache and in-flight keys include runtime plus directory and are cleared on endpoint reset.

Persisted session todos use a bounded composite key of runtime, normalized directory, and session ID. Ambiguous legacy todo entries are discarded rather than claimed by whichever runtime starts first. Authoritative deletion uses an explicit runtime identity, and session-folder deletion scans every scope in the active runtime so archived assignments cannot survive after their session is gone.

Chat composer drafts, confirmed mentions, inline-comment drafts, and pinned sessions use the same runtime/directory/session ownership rule. Chat drafts use a bounded shared envelope and notify mounted composers when authoritative deletion clears their identity, preventing unmount autosave from resurrecting deleted text. Inline drafts enforce per-session, global-session, and serialized-byte bounds. Pins retain every valid composite key across runtimes without silent age/count eviction and are never pruned from the first startup list. Confirmed local deletion and routed deletion events clear immediately; after an authoritative baseline exists, a later complete omission also cleans persisted state. Ambiguous session-only legacy drafts and pins are not claimed.

Input history keeps both runtime-wide and runtime/directory/session buckets in one bounded browser-storage envelope. The per-bucket cap is configurable from 1 through 100 and defaults to 40. Recall defaults to the current session's bucket merged with the visible transcript's user prompts; the runtime-wide bucket is opt-in through the Chat setting. Lowering the limit trims older entries from every bucket at once and cannot restore what it discards. Every scope change, limit change, append, and session cleanup rereads the latest durable envelope before applying its mutation, so a stale tab preserves history written by another tab. A failed write retains bounded before/after snapshots. The next mutation applies that local delta to the latest durable data, preserving pending appends and session deletions together with unrelated changes from other tabs. A successful durable write clears the pending delta.

Server-owned queue acceptance records the original prompt and restorable attachments against its captured runtime/directory/session identity. Rejection records nothing. Automatic delivery and manual take do not record the accepted item again. VS Code retains recording at dispatch, using the full messages actually taken for sending.

Composer draft edits remain immediate in memory and use a trailing durable-write debounce. Pending text and confirmed mentions flush synchronously when the document becomes hidden, freezes, receives `pagehide`, switches identity, or unmounts; authoritative deletion cancels pending work before any lifecycle flush can run. The shared chat-draft envelope reuses its parsed snapshot until the storage value changes. Inline-comment draft byte accounting indexes serialized buckets and recalculates only the changed session bucket during normal edits; deferred storage still performs the final full-envelope serialization and lifecycle flush.

### `useTerminalStore.ts`

`useTerminalStore` owns terminal tab arrangement per directory plus PTY scrollback.

Scrollback is deliberately **not** stored on the tab. `buffers` is a separate map keyed by
directory and tab id, and `getBuffer()` returns a shared frozen empty buffer for tabs that
have produced no output. PTY output arrives at streaming frequency, so keeping it inside
`sessions` made every output chunk allocate a new tab, a new directory entry and a new
`sessions` map. That invalidated every tab-strip subscription, re-ran the project-action
run monitor, and made Zustand persist rewrite the session-storage snapshot per chunk.

Invariants to preserve when editing:

- Directory keys come from `normalizeTerminalDirectory` (`lib/pathNormalization.ts`) and
  nothing else. Server `cwd` strings, sidebar project paths and the panel's own directory
  all pass through it, so a folder has exactly one entry on every platform. Read `sessions`
  through `getDirectoryState`, never by indexing the map with a path normalized elsewhere.
- Output actions (`appendToBuffer`, `replaceBuffer`) must leave `sessions` referentially
  unchanged; only `buffers` and `nextChunkId` may change.
- Buffer entries are owned by their tab. `closeTab`, `removeDirectory`, `clearAll`, and
  rebinding a tab to a different terminal session must drop the entry.
- Output for an unknown tab is ignored rather than creating an orphan buffer.
- Only `sessions` and `nextTabId` are persisted. `partialize` reuses its previous
  projection while both are referentially unchanged, and the storage adapter skips a write
  for an unchanged projection, so streaming output performs no persistence work.
- Consumers that react to output must subscribe to `buffers`, not `sessions`.
- Action tab IDs remain stable while each command execution receives a fresh terminal ID.
  Starting or adopting a different execution resets its buffer sequence and preview together;
  reconnecting to the same execution and observing its exit preserve scrollback.
- Reconciliation selects one record per action before updating tabs. A running execution wins
  over retained exited records independently of listing order. An in-progress stop remains
  stopping until the same execution exits or explicit termination failure restores running.
- `terminalSessionObserver` shares one five-second refresh loop per terminal adapter across
  the visible sidebar, headers and panels. The existing empty-cwd listing returns all server
  sessions in one request; directory subscribers receive only their own records. A sidebar
  subscriber reconciles the complete list, including omitted known action directories.
  Focus and online recovery refresh immediately. Hidden/offline clients pause, failed reads
  preserve state, and the last consumer stops the loop. Replaced runtimes cannot publish old
  responses. Mutation revisions are captured for every subscribed scope before the request.
- Passive action adoption may restore output but has no launch-time authority to open browser
  tabs. Preview navigation belongs to the initiating host directory even for a parent action.
- Server session listings capture the directory's per-action mutation revisions when the
  request starts. Coalesced callers share that first snapshot. A response cannot replace or
  remove an action execution mutated after its request began, while a fresh successful empty
  response still clears an omitted run.

## Git / PR Stores

The Git and PR stores are the most important stores to understand before editing this directory.

### `useGitStore.ts`

`useGitStore` is a centralized active-runtime, per-directory Git cache.

Core model:

- active runtime owns one `directories` map keyed by directory
- each directory entry contains:
  - repo detection
  - status
  - branches
  - log
  - identity
  - diff cache
  - per-directory loading flags
  - freshness timestamps

Important properties:

- `directories: Map<string, DirectoryGitState>` is the source of truth
- loading state is per-directory, not global
- `ensureStatus()` and `ensureAll()` are the preferred entry points for consumers
- in-flight dedupe exists for status and `ensureAll()`; status dedupe is scoped to the per-directory status mutation revision, so a refresh requested after a mutation never joins a pre-mutation in-flight request
- nested repository discovery (`nestedReposByRoot`, `nestedRepoSelection`, `ensureNestedRepos`) is per-root state for roots that are not themselves git repositories; discovery failure is a `null` marker (never a valid empty result), a runtime without the discovery route (VS Code) commits an `'unsupported'` marker, and an in-flight discovery whose runtime switched is discarded at commit time instead of repopulating the cleared map. Selections are persisted per runtime + root, and `useEffectiveGitDirectory(root)` resolves the directory git surfaces operate on (`root` when the root is a repository, the selected nested repository otherwise). A selection whose repository fails its probe is dropped and remembered session-only (`staleClearedSelections`) so auto-select does not re-pick it and loop walk+probe; manual picker picks bypass the memory. `hooks/useNestedGitDirectory.ts` owns the resolution flow (root probe, discovery, auto-select, stale-selection recovery) for every consuming surface (Git tab, diff view, pull-request view, walkthrough view, mobile changes, work-status project readout), and `git/NestedRepoResolutionStates.tsx` renders the shared pending/failed/unsupported/empty states
- worktree bootstrap polling and session/worktree machinery stay keyed on the project root even while a nested repository is selected; only git data and actions follow the selection
- runtime reset replaces all live entries with that runtime's persisted branch seeds and invalidates old completions
- status, branches, log, identity, repository probes, and prefetch diffs commit through runtime and per-channel generations
- status mutations advance a revision so older refreshes cannot undo optimistic or confirmed index changes
- a successful status-affecting git mutation also advances that revision: the HTTP adapter's cache invalidation notifies the store through `lib/gitStatusInvalidation.ts` (the VS Code bridge adapter has no client-side status cache, so it emits nothing today)
- `fetchStatus({ force: true })` and `fetchAll({ force: true })` cross both the store and runtime transport caches; a forced reconciliation must reach the active runtime rather than reuse an unexpired browser status snapshot
- status requests do not start while a managed worktree bootstrap is pending, and a response admitted before bootstrap began is discarded if it completes after the directory enters `pending`; the `--no-checkout` population window is not user working-tree state
- branch persistence is versioned, bounded, runtime-scoped, and claims the ambiguous legacy cache once
- diff data has per-directory and aggregate count/UTF-8-byte limits; oversized single entries are rejected

Diff prefetch admits at most two outstanding transport requests per runtime and directory across overlapping batches. Its 15-second deadline stops waiting for a result; it does not cancel server work. A timed-out request retains its path and concurrency slot until the transport settles, including across cache resets, so later batches cannot repeat it or exceed the limit. Saturated prefetch skips further work instead of queueing retries. Late timed-out results never enter the cache, and successful or rejected transport completion releases capacity. Duplicate or saturated demand does not invalidate a batch already running. The Git view schedules prefetch only while active; explicit file opens remain independent of background prefetch capacity.

### `useGitHubPrStatusStore.ts`

`useGitHubPrStatusStore` is a centralized PR cache keyed by a collision-safe tuple of runtime, directory, branch, and requested remote.

Core model:

- each entry stores:
  - current PR status payload
  - loading / error state
  - whether initial status was resolved
  - refresh timestamps
  - watch count
  - runtime params
  - resolved identity

Important properties:

- `ensureEntry()` initializes a key lazily
- `setParams()` attaches runtime context
- parameter changes advance an entry revision; stale queued, successful, and failed requests cannot update a newer authority
- `startWatching()` / `stopWatching()` are for true live PR consumers only
- `refreshTargets()` supports one-shot multi-target bootstrap without turning on live watching
- `syncOpenPrSummaries()` keeps unwatched open PRs live through one batched summary request; it skips watched entries and PRs checked within `minAgeMs`, applies only answers newer than the entry's `fetchedAt`, leaves semantically unchanged entries untouched, and drops a batch that outlived a runtime switch; `linkedRefs` add the PRs linked to sessions on screen to the same batch, answered into the runtime-only `linkedSummaries` map (merged links are final and not asked again); `linkedIssueRefs` do the same for GitHub issues linked to sessions, answered into the runtime-only `linkedIssueSummaries` (asked on every cadence, since an issue can reopen)
- runtime reset disposes timers, watchers, API references, and request ownership while inert namespaced snapshots remain isolated
- persisted cache is versioned, TTL-filtered, and bounded for page refresh continuity, not broad background syncing
- a closed/merged PR is the branch's history, not live status: it is displayed and persisted, but never treated as authority
- closed/merged associations use the same `5m` discovery cadence as missing PRs so a newer open PR (or authoritative `pr: null`) replaces them without a manual refresh
- hydrate restores a persisted closed/merged PR but resets its `lastDiscoveryPollAt`, so revalidation runs on the first watcher tick after a reload
- a successful refresh that returns `pr: null` replaces any previously cached PR authoritatively; a failed refresh keeps the previous one

## Ownership Rules

These rules are important. Breaking them tends to reintroduce idle CPU churn, stale UI, or rerender fanout.

1. No broad `directories` or `entries` subscriptions in normal UI components.
2. No root pollers for Git or PR.
3. No broad idle sweeps across many directories.
4. Prefer store `ensure*` methods over direct runtime API calls from views.
5. Visible consumers should drive refresh. Hidden consumers should not.
6. Header should not depend on PR store.
7. A closed context panel (or hidden git surface) should not create live PR work.
8. File tree Git status should update only when the file tree is visible.
9. Global session refresh must remain bounded and failure-isolated per directory.
10. Global session cache must not drive live activity indicators or message-loading state.

### Configuration stores and the Settings directory

`useAgentsStore`, `useCommandsStore`, `useSkillsStore`, `useMcpConfigStore` and
the provider half of `useConfigStore` describe directory-scoped configuration.
Provider and agent catalogs use the actual worktree directory when selected;
the parent project still supplies its OpenChamber project defaults.
Two surfaces read them at once: the app (chat, autocompletes, pickers), which
wants the active project, and Settings, whose own project selector may point
somewhere else.

Each of them therefore keeps two things:

- a per-directory map (`agentsByDirectory`, `commandsByDirectory`,
  `skillsByDirectory`, `serversByDirectory`, `directoryScoped`);
- a flat mirror (`agents`, `commands`, `skills`, `mcpServers`, `providers`) that
  tracks the **active** directory only.

A project whose OpenCode config OpenCode rejects (`ConfigInvalidError` and the
other `Config*Error` names) is recorded in `useConfigStore.projectConfigErrors`,
keyed by config directory, runtime-only. `loadAgents` stops retrying on it and a
successful load clears it. `initializeApp` treats it as that project's failure,
not the app's: startup completes so other projects stay reachable, and
`ProjectConfigErrorToast` shows the file and message while that project is
active.

Any other failed `initializeApp` attempt records `lastInitFailure` (runtime-only,
cleared on success and on runtime switch): which step failed —
`serverUnreachable` (no answer or a gateway error), `openCodeUnavailable` (the
server answered but OpenCode is not healthy), `loadAgents`, or `unexpected` —
plus the error text when there is one. The startup recovery screen reads it, so
only a real network failure tells the user to check that the server is running.

#### What they hold: OpenCode 2 entity shapes

The mutation payloads these stores send are the v2 entities documented in
`packages/web/server/lib/opencode/DOCUMENTATION.md` ("Entity routes (v2
shapes)"). Agents carry `system`, `steps`, `request.body.temperature` /
`top_p`, a joined `provider/model#variant` string and an ordered `permissions`
rule list; commands carry `template` and `subagent`; MCP servers carry
`disabled`, `codemode` and `timeout: { startup, catalog, execution }`.

Two rules follow from the routes:

- **The list is not the config.** `opencodeClient.listAgents` answers OpenCode's
  RESOLVED `AgentInfo` (built-in defaults and global config already merged), and
  the v2 `CommandInfo` carries only a name and a description. Anything that
  edits, duplicates or renames an entity reads its own stored entry instead:
  `useAgentsStore.fetchAgentEntity` / `fetchAgentPermissions`, and the
  per-command `…/config` read inside `useCommandsStore.loadCommands`.
- **`request` and `permissions` are replaced wholesale by a PATCH.** A caller
  must send the full block it wants persisted; sending only the field it changed
  drops the rest.

Config reads also report `legacy: true` when the entity's file still uses v1
spellings, and mutations answer with the `path` they wrote. The stores surface
`legacy` and `path` on the entity so a page can show the quiet note; no file is
ever moved.

Thinking variants keep the effective value in `currentVariant` so existing send
paths capture a stable configuration. `currentVariantSelection` says where that
value came from: a string is an effort chosen in the picker or by the shortcut,
`null` is an explicit `Default`, and `undefined` is automatic initialization,
which lets the inherited default apply.

`Default` sends no effort at all. It cannot resolve back to the inherited
default: the settings default would take effect again, and the next assistant
reply echoes that effort back as an explicit choice, so the picker jumps off
`Default` one message after the user chose it. For the same reason the
per-session selection store records an explicit `Default` (as `null`) instead of
clearing the entry — a cleared entry is indistinguishable from never having
chosen, and the settings default wins again on the next agent or session switch.

Only a place where the user chose may write `null`. Restore paths — message
history, a preserved manual override — pass their own "found nothing" through
as `undefined`, because a session whose history carries no effort is not a
session where `Default` was picked. A restore that manufactures `null` latches
the session onto `Default`: `null` outranks the agent and settings defaults by
design, so the concrete effort it displaced can never come back.

Every write of `currentVariant` writes `currentVariantSelection` with it. They
are one selection; updating only the effective value leaves the picker showing
one effort while sends carry another.

Every loader and mutation takes an explicit directory; omitting it means the
active project, which is what non-Settings callers pass. A load for another
directory writes the map and leaves the mirror alone, so browsing another
project in Settings cannot change what chat sees. Components select through
`selectAgentsForDirectory` / `selectCommandsForDirectory` /
`selectSkillsForDirectory` / `selectMcpServersForDirectory` /
`selectProvidersForDirectory`, which return stored arrays.

Command discovery compares responses only with the requested directory's cache.
A first successful response always creates that entry, even when empty or
identical to another project's commands. Cached and unchanged loads restore the
active-project mirror; asynchronous completions check the active directory at
commit time. Failed loads leave the current cache untouched. Discovery passes
its directory directly to the SDK wrapper without changing the client's shared
directory context.

Settings resolves its directory through `useSettingsDirectory`, backed by
`useUIStore.settingsProjectPath`. That selection is Settings-local and not
persisted: it follows the active project until the user picks another one. The
Settings project selector must never call `setActiveProject` — that relocates
the chat, the session list and the file tree.

Failure is still not empty: a failed load restores that directory's previous
list rather than clearing it.

## Selector Rules

Use leaf selectors.

Good:

- `useGitStatus(directory)`
- `useGitBranches(directory)`
- `useGitBranchLabel(directory)`
- `useGitRepoStatusMap(directories)`

Bad:

- `useGitStore((state) => state.directories)` in feature components
- `useGitHubPrStatusStore((state) => state.entries)` in feature components
- render-time scans over every PR entry for a single project/group badge

Why this matters:

- Zustand reruns selectors on every `set`
- rerenders are avoided only if the selected result stays referentially stable
- broad subscriptions magnify fanout even when only one directory changed

## Performance Rules

### 1. Preserve references for unaffected entities

If directory `A` changes, directory `B` should keep the same derived reference where possible.

### 2. Keep loading state per entity

Do not add new global `isLoadingWhatever` flags for keyed cache work.

### 3. Avoid hidden work

If a surface is not visible, it should not keep refreshing Git/PR state.

Examples:

- `PullRequestSection` may watch a PR while visible
- `SessionSidebar` may bootstrap missing PR data for expanded visible groups
- hidden sidebar should not watch PRs

### 4. Prefer one-shot event hints over polling

Example already in use:

- successful mutating tools emit a centralized Git refresh hint through `sessionEvents`
- visible `GitView` / `DiffView` consume the hint and refresh current-directory status

This is preferred over background polling.

### 5. Treat `diffStats` carefully

`GitStatus.diffStats` may be omitted by light status fetches.

Rules:

- do not erase richer existing `diffStats` with a lighter payload
- if a UI surface requires per-file `+/-` stats, it must ensure a full enough status payload exists

### 6. Keep diff cache bounded

Diff cache has explicit limits because large repos can otherwise blow up memory.

Do not raise limits casually.

## Refresh Model

### Git

Expected model:

- `GitView` / `DiffView` ensure current-directory Git state when visible
- the Git view gates its status-derived content and actions while a managed worktree bootstrap is pending, then keeps the gate closed until one forced fresh status read succeeds; refresh failure exposes retry without revealing the cached bootstrap snapshot
- explicit Git actions refresh status/branches/log as needed
- every status-affecting git mutation invalidates the HTTP adapter's status cache on its success path (failed mutations invalidate nothing), so the follow-up refresh is authoritative instead of the pre-mutation cache entry
- the sync event handler issues one Git refresh hint when a live file-mutating tool first reaches `completed`; this does not depend on `ToolPart` mounting, and duplicate terminal events do not replay the hint
- every Git refresh hint invalidates the store request generation and the HTTP status cache before visible consumers request status, so they share one post-mutation read instead of accepting a cached or pre-mutation response
- a successful dirty save from the in-app file editor issues a path-scoped Git refresh hint; clean autosave checks remain no-ops
- refresh hints with authoritative file paths invalidate only those cached and currently rendered diffs before status refresh; pathless tools request status reconciliation without broadly remounting DiffView
- targeted diff remounts preserve the user's current file-section anchor and intra-file offset before paint instead of resetting the stacked view to the top
- no root-level background Git polling

### PR

Expected model:

- `PullRequestSection` is the only true live PR watcher
- `SessionSidebar` may do one-shot bootstrap for expanded visible project/worktree groups if PR info is missing
- no live PR work for header
- no background PR sweeps outside visible demand

## Known Intentional Fallbacks

There is still one explicit fallback path worth knowing about:

- `SessionSidebar` may call `checkIsGitRepository(...)` during initial worktree/project discovery when store state is not populated yet

This is currently acceptable as a narrow bootstrap fallback.

Do not widen it into a polling or broad refresh system.

## When Editing These Stores

Before changing store shape or selectors, ask:

1. Is this keyed by the right identity (directory, branch, session, root)?
2. Will this force unrelated consumers to rerender?
3. Should this be visible-demand-driven instead of background-driven?
4. Is there already a store cache for this data?
5. Am I duplicating fetch ownership in a component when it should live in a store action?

## Validation Checklist

After meaningful Git/PR store changes, verify manually:

1. Idle desktop app stays quiet on draft/chat screen.
2. Git view still loads status, branches, log, identity.
3. Diff view still opens the correct file and stays in sync.
4. Worktree sessions still show branch labels in header.
5. Expanded sidebar projects/worktrees can show PR state without requiring prior selection.
6. Hidden surfaces do not reintroduce live background work.
