/**
 * The trust prompt for a team's shared project setup.
 *
 * Commands in `<repo>/.openchamber/project.json` run on this machine, and a
 * `git pull` can change them. So the first time a shared setup command or a
 * shared action is about to run, the app shows exactly what would run and
 * asks. The answer is recorded on the instance against a hash of those
 * commands (`trust.hash`); a pull that changes them brings the prompt back.
 *
 * One request is active at a time; a newer one settles the pending one as
 * `skip`. The dialog (`SharedTrustConfirmDialog`) renders the pending request
 * on every surface.
