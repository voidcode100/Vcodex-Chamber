/**
 * "Is a hardware keyboard attached?" — the input the mobile layout uses to
 * decide whether a soft keyboard will ever eat the screen.
 *
 * Two sources, in priority order:
 *
 * 1. The native answer. On iOS the shell reads `GCKeyboard` and stamps
 *    `window.__OPENCHAMBER_HARDWARE_KEYBOARD__` at document start, then keeps it
 *    live via `oc:hardware-keyboard` (see BridgeViewController). This is
 *    authoritative and — crucially — known BEFORE the user focuses anything, so
 *    the draft screen and composer start in the right shape instead of
 *    re-laying-out after the first focus.
 * 2. Inference, for runtimes with no native answer (Android, hosted mobile).
 *    A `keyboardWillShow` with a real height means there IS a soft keyboard; a
 *    tiny height means only iOS' shortcut strip; focus with no event at all
 *    within a short window means nothing was presented. Inference is ignored
 *    entirely once the native source has spoken.
 *
 * Everything else stays `false`, which is the safe default: the layout then
 * behaves exactly as it does on a phone.
 *
 * In memory only — a keyboard can be attached and detached while the app runs,
 * and both sources re-answer the question continuously.
