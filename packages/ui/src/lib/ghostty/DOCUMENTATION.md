# libghostty-vt Terminal Adapter

## Ownership

This directory is OpenChamber's browser adapter for the official `libghostty-vt` C ABI, adapted from T3 Code (see `LICENSE-T3CODE`). It replaces the `ghostty-web` npm package: the emulator, the renderer and the input layer are all owned here, so a terminal bug is fixed in this directory rather than patched around in `node_modules`.

- `runtime.ts` owns the single WebAssembly instance per page, the C struct layouts read from `ghostty_type_json`, allocation helpers, and the PTY write callback trampoline (embedded bytes compiled from `../../../scripts/ghostty-write-pty.zig`).
- `core.ts` owns one terminal's Ghostty handles: VT writes, resize, theme and 256-color palette, selection, key/mouse/paste encoding, and the render-state snapshot (`GhosttySnapshot`) the renderer draws.
- `renderer.ts` paints a snapshot into a Canvas 2D context: background runs, text runs, decorations, cursor. It measures the cell from the faces that will render.
- `surface.ts` owns the DOM: canvas, hidden textarea (keyboard, IME, clipboard), scrollbar, pointer selection, link hover/activation, mouse reporting, wheel scrolling, cursor blink, DPR changes, and the fit/notify cycle toward the PTY.
- `boxDrawing.ts` draws Box Drawing (U+2500–U+257F), Block Elements (U+2580–U+259F) and Powerline arrows (U+E0B0–U+E0B3) procedurally to the exact cell; the renderer never sends those to the font.
- `keyCodes.ts` mirrors the `GhosttyKey` enum of the pinned revision. `terminalLinks.ts` matches URLs across soft-wrapped rows. `fonts.ts` normalizes family lists for the canvas font shorthand and probes for monospace advances.
- `vendor/` holds the reproducible artifact (`ghostty-vt.wasm`), the pinned upstream revision (`VERSION`) and Ghostty's license. `fonts/` vendors the symbols-only Nerd Font (MIT) so prompt glyphs render without a locally installed Nerd Font and without a CDN.

`components/terminal/TerminalViewport.tsx` is the only React consumer. React stays out of the render loop: the surface schedules its own frames.

The viewport owns the desktop Copy/Paste context menu. Its trigger accepts only the native event forwarded by `surface.onContextMenu`, so mouse-reporting applications retain right clicks and the surface's Shift override still applies. Touch-owned viewports keep their existing gestures. Copy snapshots the selection when the menu opens; Paste uses `surface.pasteFromClipboard` for bracketed-paste encoding and native-paste deduplication. The viewport invalidates pending clipboard reads on session changes, hide and unmount. Clipboard read failures show a translated error with a keyboard-paste fallback.

## Invariants

- On macOS, unshifted Option+Left/Right sends ESC+b/f and Option+Backspace sends Ctrl+W at legacy prompts. `core.encodeMacWordShortcut` checks the active screen and Kitty keyboard flags before translating; alternate-screen and Kitty-enabled programs receive the original keys. `surface.ts` consumes the matching keyup for translated shortcuts. Other platforms, extra modifiers and Option character input retain normal encoding.
- The grid is measured after the faces that will render are loaded (`document.fonts.load` for every style plus the bundled symbols font). A face that finishes loading later triggers a re-measure through `loadingdone`. Never size the grid from a fallback face on purpose.
- Generic keywords Chromium's canvas parser rejects (`ui-monospace`, `system-ui`) are stripped before any `context.font` assignment; an invalid shorthand silently no-ops and the grid would be measured with the previous font.
- The canvas context is created with `willReadFrequently: true`, which pins it to the software rasterizer. Gecko otherwise picks acceleration per canvas, and its GPU text path on macOS skips CoreText smoothing: a terminal created after page load drew thin, pencil-like glyphs while the first one stayed on the software path (confirmed: `gfx.canvas.accelerated=false` in Zen removed the symptom). The backing store is also sized to the mount at DPR before the first paint, so the compositor never sees the default 300×150 store stretched.
- Cell-filling symbols (borders, bars, block logos) are drawn by `boxDrawing.ts`, snapped to whole CSS pixels so neighbouring cells meet without seams. Fonts draw these only as tall as their em box, so at the 1.35 em line height every TUI border showed a strip of background between rows.
- The PTY hears about a resize only after the grid settles (150 ms) and at most once per fit; `onResize` is the sole resize channel. The first successful fit always notifies, even at the construction size.
- History replay (`resetAndWrite`) detaches the PTY writer so historical device queries never reach the live shell, and runs at the PTY size the history was drawn for when the caller passes one, so Ghostty reflows lines where the shell wrapped them.
- A hidden surface (`setVisible(false)`) keeps parsing output and answering VT queries but schedules no frames, no cursor timer and no scrollbar work. Reveal repaints in full.
- Touch hosts (`handleTouchPointer: false`) own scroll and long-press gestures through `scrollLines`, `selectWordAt` and `extendSelectionTo`; the surface ignores touch pointers and the compatibility mouse events that follow them so a tap does not summon the soft keyboard.
- Every terminal frees its own handles on `dispose()`; the WebAssembly instance is shared and never torn down.

## Updating libghostty-vt

1. Put the new upstream commit hash in `vendor/VERSION`.
2. Run `bun run --cwd packages/ui build:ghostty-wasm`. It downloads Zig 0.15.2 into `~/.cache/openchamber-ghostty`, clones Ghostty at the pin, builds `wasm32-freestanding`, replaces `vendor/ghostty-vt.wasm`, and prints the trampoline bytes for `runtime.ts` (they only change when the Zig source changes).
3. Reconcile the ABI numbers in `core.ts` (`RENDER_DATA`, `ROW_DATA`, `CELL_DATA`, option ids in `setTheme`, `ghostty_terminal_get` ids) and `keyCodes.ts` against the headers of the new revision.
4. `runtime.test.ts` fails when the artifact's embedded build metadata disagrees with `VERSION`.

On macOS 27 with Xcode 26+ SDKs the script works around a Zig 0.15.2 limitation: the SDK's `libSystem.tbd` lists only `arm64e-macos`, so the script builds a patched SDK root and shims `xcrun` for the duration of the build.

## Verification

```sh
bun test packages/ui/src/lib/ghostty packages/ui/src/components/terminal
bun run --cwd packages/ui type-check
```

The `core` and `runtime` tests run the real WebAssembly under bun; they cover reflow, palette, replay isolation and recycled-row cleanliness.
